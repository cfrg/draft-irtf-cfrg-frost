--- abstract

In this draft, we present the two-round signing variant of FROST, a Flexible Round-Optimized
Schnorr Threshold signature scheme. FROST signatures can be issued after a threshold number
of entities cooperate to issue a signature, allowing for improved distribution of trust and
redundancy with respect to a secret key. Further, this draft specifies signatures that are
compatible with {{!RFC8032}}. However, unlike {{!RFC8032}}, the protocol for producing
signatures in this draft is not deterministic, so as to ensure protection against a
key-recovery attack that is possible when even only one participant is malicious.

# Introduction

DISCLAIMER: This is a work-in-progress draft of FROST.

RFC EDITOR: PLEASE REMOVE THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH The source for this draft is
maintained in GitHub. Suggested changes should be submitted as pull requests
at https://github.com/cfrg/draft-irtf-cfrg-frost. Instructions are on that page as
well.

Unlike signatures in a single-party setting, threshold signatures
require cooperation among a threshold number of signers each holding a share
of a common private key. The security of threshold schemes in general assume
that an adversary can corrupt strictly fewer than a threshold number of participants.

This document presents a variant of a Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold (FROST)
signature scheme originally defined in {{FROST20}}. FROST reduces network overhead during
threshold signing operations while employing a novel technique to protect against forgery
attacks applicable to prior Schnorr-based threshold signature constructions. The variant of
FROST presented in this document requires two rounds to compute a signature. Single-round
signing with FROST is out of scope.

For select ciphersuites, the signatures produced by this draft are compatible with
{{!RFC8032}}. However, unlike {{!RFC8032}}, signatures produced by FROST are not
deterministic, since deriving nonces deterministically allows for a complete key-recovery
attack in multi-party discrete logarithm-based signatures, such as FROST.

While an optimization to FROST was shown in {{Schnorr21}} that reduces scalar multiplications
from linear in the number of signers to constant, this draft does not specify that optimization
due to the malleability that this optimization introduces, as shown in {{StrongerSec22}}.
Specifically, this optimization removes the guarantee that the set of signers that started
round one of the protocol is the same set of signers that produced the signature output by
round two.

Key generation for FROST signing is out of scope for this document. However, for completeness,
key generation with a trusted dealer is specified in {{dep-dealer}}.

# Conventions and Definitions

{::boilerplate bcp14}

The following terminology is used throughout this document.

* A participant is an entity that is trusted to hold and use a signing key share.
* `MAX_SIGNERS` denotes the number of participants, and the number of shares that `s` is split into. This value MUST NOT exceed 2^16-1.
* `MIN_SIGNERS` denotes the threshold number of participants required to issue a signature, where MIN_SIGNERS <= MAX_SIGNERS.
* `NUM_SIGNERS` denotes the number of signers that participate in an invocation of FROST signing, where
  MIN_SIGNERS <= NUM_SIGNERS <= MAX_SIGNERS.
* An identifier is an integer value associated with a participant, or signer,
  and is a value in the range [1, MAX_SIGNERS].

Additionally, the following notation is used throughout the document.

* `encode_uint16(x)`: Convert two byte unsigned integer (uint16) `x` to a 2-byte,
  big-endian byte string. For example, `encode_uint16(310) = [0x01, 0x36]`.
* `random_bytes(n)`: Outputs `n` bytes, sampled uniformly at random
using a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG).
* `len(l)`: Outputs the length of input list `l`, e.g., `len([1,2,3]) = 3)`.
* `reverse(l)`: Outputs the list `l` in reverse order, e.g., `reverse([1,2,3]) = [3,2,1]`.
* `range(a, b)`: Outputs a list of integers from `a` to `b-1` in ascending order, e.g., `range(1, 4) = [1,2,3]`.
* `pow(a, b)`: Output the integer result of `a` to the power of `b`, e.g., `pow(2, 3) = 8`.
* \|\| denotes concatenation, i.e., x \|\| y = xy.
* nil denotes an empty byte string.

Unless otherwise stated, we assume that secrets are sampled uniformly at random
using a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG); see
{{?RFC4086}} for additional guidance on the generation of random numbers.

# Cryptographic Dependencies

FROST signing depends on the following cryptographic constructs:

- Prime-order Group, {{dep-pog}};
- Cryptographic hash function, {{dep-hash}};

These are described in the following sections.

## Prime-Order Group {#dep-pog}

FROST depends on an abelian group of prime order `p`. We represent this
group as the object `G` that additionally defines helper functions described below. The group operation
for `G` is addition `+` with identity element `I`. For any elements `A` and `B` of the group `G`,
`A + B = B + A` is also a member of `G`. Also, for any `A` in `G`, there exists an element
`-A` such that `A + (-A) = (-A) + A = I`. For convenience, we use `-` to denote
subtraction, e.g., `A - B = A + (-B)`. Scalar multiplication is equivalent to the repeated
application of the group operation on an element A with itself `r-1` times, this is denoted
as `r*A = A + ... + A`. For any element `A`, `p * A = I`. We denote `B` as a fixed generator
of the group. Scalar base multiplication is equivalent to the repeated application of the group
operation `B` with itself `r-1` times, this is denoted as `ScalarBaseMult(r)`. The set of
scalars corresponds to `GF(p)`, which we refer to as the scalar field. This document uses types
`Element` and `Scalar` to denote elements of the group `G` and its set of scalars, respectively.
We denote equality comparison as `==` and assignment of values by `=`.

We now detail a number of member functions that can be invoked on `G`.

- Order(): Outputs the order of `G` (i.e. `p`).
- Identity(): Outputs the identity `Element` of the group (i.e. `I`).
- RandomScalar(): Outputs a random `Scalar` element in GF(p).
- SerializeElement(A): Maps an `Element` `A` to a unique byte array `buf` of fixed length `Ne`.
- DeserializeElement(buf): Attempts to map a byte array `buf` to an `Element` `A`,
  and fails if the input is not a valid byte representation of an element of
  the group. This function can raise a DeserializeError if deserialization fails
  or `A` is the identity element of the group; see {{ciphersuites}} for group-specific
  input validation steps.
- SerializeScalar(s): Maps a Scalar `s` to a unique byte array `buf` of fixed length `Ns`.
- DeserializeScalar(buf): Attempts to map a byte array `buf` to a `Scalar` `s`.
  This function can raise a DeserializeError if deserialization fails; see
  {{ciphersuites}} for group-specific input validation steps.

## Cryptographic Hash Function {#dep-hash}

FROST requires the use of a cryptographically secure hash function, generically
written as H, which functions effectively as a random oracle. For concrete
recommendations on hash functions which SHOULD be used in practice, see
{{ciphersuites}}. Using H, we introduce separate domain-separated hashes,
H1, H2, H3, H4, and H5:

- H1, H2, and H3 map arbitrary byte strings to Scalar elements of the prime-order group scalar field.
- H4 and H5 are aliases for H with distinct domain separators.

The details of H1, H2, H3, H4, and H5 vary based on ciphersuite. See {{ciphersuites}}
for more details about each.

# Helper functions {#helpers}

Beyond the core dependencies, the protocol in this document depends on the
following helper operations:

- Nonce generation, {{dep-nonces}}
- Polynomial operations, {{dep-polynomial}};
- Encoding operations, {{dep-encoding}};
- Signature binding {{dep-binding-factor}}, group commitment {{dep-group-commit}}, and challenge computation {{dep-sig-challenge}}

These sections describes these operations in more detail.

## Nonce generation {#dep-nonces}

To hedge against a bad RNG that outputs predictable values, we generate
nonces by sourcing fresh randomness and combine with the secret key,
to create a domain-separated hash function from the ciphersuite hash
function `H`, `H4`:

~~~
  nonce_generate(secret):

  Inputs:
  - secret, a Scalar

  Outputs: nonce, a Scalar

  def nonce_generate(secret):
    k_enc = random_bytes(32)
    secret_enc = G.SerializeScalar(secret)
    return H3(k_enc || secret_enc)
~~~

## Polynomial Operations {#dep-polynomial}

This section describes operations on and associated with polynomials over Scalars
that are used in the main signing protocol. A polynomial of maximum degree t
is represented as a list of t coefficients, where the constant term of the polynomial
is in the first position and the highest-degree coefficient is in the last position.
A point on the polynomial is a tuple (x, y), where `y = f(x)`. For notational
convenience, we refer to the x-coordinate and y-coordinate of a
point p as `p.x` and `p.y`, respectively.

### Evaluation of a polynomial

This section describes a method for evaluating a polynomial `f` at a
particular input `x`, i.e., `y = f(x)` using Horner's method.

~~~
  polynomial_evaluate(x, coeffs):

  Inputs:
  - x, input at which to evaluate the polynomial, a Scalar
  - coeffs, the polynomial coefficients, a list of Scalars

  Outputs: Scalar result of the polynomial evaluated at input x

  def polynomial_evaluate(x, coeffs):
    value = 0
    for coeff in reverse(coeffs):
      value *= x
      value += coeff
    return value
~~~

### Lagrange coefficients

The function `derive_lagrange_coefficient` derives a Lagrange coefficient
to later perform polynomial interpolation, and is provided a list of x-coordinates
as input. Note that `derive_lagrange_coefficient` does not permit any x-coordinate
to equal 0. Lagrange coefficients are used in FROST to evaluate a polynomial `f`
at x-coordinate 0, i.e., `f(0)`, given a list of `t` other x-coordinates.

~~~
  derive_lagrange_coefficient(x_i, L):

  Inputs:
  - x_i, an x-coordinate contained in L, a Scalar
  - L, the set of x-coordinates, each a Scalar

  Outputs: L_i, the i-th Lagrange coefficient

  Errors:
  - "invalid parameters", if any x-coordinate is equal to 0 or if x_i
    is not in L

  def derive_lagrange_coefficient(x_i, L):
    if x_i == 0:
      raise "invalid parameters"
    for x_j in L:
      if x_j == 0:
        raise "invalid parameters"
    if x_i not in L:
      raise "invalid parameters"

    numerator = Scalar(1)
    denominator = Scalar(1)
    for x_j in L:
      if x_j == x_i: continue
      numerator *= x_j
      denominator *= x_j - x_i

    L_i = numerator / denominator
    return L_i
~~~

### Deriving the constant term of a polynomial

Secret sharing requires "splitting" a secret, which is represented as
a constant term of some polynomial `f` of degree `t-1`. Recovering the
constant term occurs with a set of `t` points using polynomial
interpolation, defined as follows.

~~~
  Inputs:
  - points, a set of t points on a polynomial f, each a tuple of two
    Scalar values representing the x and y coordinates

  Outputs: The constant term of f, i.e., f(0)

  def polynomial_interpolation(points):
    L = []
    for point in points:
      L.append(point.x)

    f_zero = Scalar(0)
    for point in points:
      delta = point.y * derive_lagrange_coefficient(point.x, L)
      f_zero = f_zero + delta

    return f_zero
~~~

## List Operations {#dep-encoding}

This section describes helper functions that work on lists of values produced
during the FROST protocol. The following function encodes a list of signer
commitments into a bytestring for use in the FROST protocol.

~~~
  Inputs:
  - commitment_list = [(i, hiding_nonce_commitment_i, binding_nonce_commitment_i), ...],
    a list of commitments issued by each signer, where each element in the list
    indicates the signer identifier i and their two commitment Element values
    (hiding_nonce_commitment_i, binding_nonce_commitment_i). This list MUST be sorted
    in ascending order by signer identifier.

  Outputs: A byte string containing the serialized representation of commitment_list

  def encode_group_commitment_list(commitment_list):
    encoded_group_commitment = nil
    for (identifier, hiding_nonce_commitment, binding_nonce_commitment) in commitment_list:
      encoded_commitment = encode_uint16(identifier) ||
                           G.SerializeElement(hiding_nonce_commitment) ||
                           G.SerializeElement(binding_nonce_commitment)
      encoded_group_commitment = encoded_group_commitment || encoded_commitment
    return encoded_group_commitment
~~~

The following function is used to extract participant identifiers from a commitment
list.

~~~
  Inputs:
  - commitment_list = [(i, hiding_nonce_commitment_i, binding_nonce_commitment_i), ...],
    a list of commitments issued by each signer, where each element in the list
    indicates the signer identifier i and their two commitment Element values
    (hiding_nonce_commitment_i, binding_nonce_commitment_i). This list MUST be sorted
    in ascending order by signer identifier.

  Outputs: A list of signer participant identifiers

def participants_from_commitment_list(commitment_list):
  identifiers = []
  for (identifier, _, _) in commitment_list:
    identifiers.append(identifier)
  return identifiers
~~~

The following function is used to extract a binding factor from a list of binding factors.

~~~
  Inputs:
  - binding_factor_list = [(i, binding_factor), ...],
    a list of binding factors for each signer, where each element in the list
    indicates the signer identifier i and their binding factor. This list MUST be sorted
    in ascending order by signer identifier.
  - identifier, Identifier i of the signer.

  Outputs: A Scalar value.

  Errors: "invalid participant", when the designated participant is not known

def binding_factor_for_participant(binding_factor_list, identifier):
  binding_factors = []
  for (i, binding_factor) in commitment_list:
    if identifier == i:
      return binding_factor
  raise "invalid participant"
~~~

## Binding Factors Computation {#dep-binding-factor}

This section describes the subroutine for computing binding factors based
on the signer commitment list and message to be signed.

~~~
  Inputs:
  - commitment_list = [(i, hiding_nonce_commitment_i, binding_nonce_commitment_i), ...],
    a list of commitments issued by each signer, where each element in the list
    indicates the signer identifier i and their two commitment Element values
    (hiding_nonce_commitment_i, binding_nonce_commitment_i). This list MUST be sorted
    in ascending order by signer identifier.
  - msg, the message to be signed.

  Outputs: A list of (identifier, Scalar) tuples representing the binding factors.

  def compute_binding_factors(commitment_list, msg):
    msg_hash = H4(msg)
    encoded_commitment_hash = H5(encode_group_commitment_list(commitment_list))
    rho_input_prefix = msg_hash || encoded_commitment_hash

    binding_factor_list = []
    for (identifier, hiding_nonce_commitment, binding_nonce_commitment) in commitment_list:
      rho_input = rho_input_prefix || encode_uint16(identifier)
      binding_factor = H1(rho_input)
      binding_factor_list.append((identifier, binding_factor))
    return binding_factor_list
~~~

## Group Commitment Computation {#dep-group-commit}

This section describes the subroutine for creating the group commitment
from a commitment list.

~~~
  Inputs:
  - commitment_list =
     [(i, hiding_nonce_commitment_i, binding_nonce_commitment_i), ...], a list
    of commitments issued by each signer, where each element in the list
    indicates the signer identifier i and their two commitment Element values
    (hiding_nonce_commitment_i, binding_nonce_commitment_i). This list MUST be
    sorted in ascending order by signer identifier.
  - binding_factor_list = [(i, binding_factor), ...],
    a list of (identifier, Scalar) tuples representing the binding factor Scalar
    for the given identifier. This list MUST be sorted in ascending order by identifier.

  Outputs: An Element in G representing the group commitment

  def compute_group_commitment(commitment_list, binding_factor_list):
    group_commitment = G.Identity()
    for (identifier, hiding_nonce_commitment, binding_nonce_commitment) in commitment_list:
      binding_factor = binding_factor_for_participant(binding_factors, identifier)
      group_commitment = group_commitment +
        (hiding_nonce_commitment + (binding_factor * binding_nonce_commitment))
    return group_commitment
~~~

## Signature Challenge Computation {#dep-sig-challenge}

This section describes the subroutine for creating the per-message challenge.

~~~
  Inputs:
  - group_commitment, an Element in G representing the group commitment
  - group_public_key, public key corresponding to the group signing key, an
    Element in G.
  - msg, the message to be signed.

  Outputs: A Scalar representing the challenge

  def compute_challenge(group_commitment, group_public_key, msg):
    group_comm_enc = G.SerializeElement(group_commitment)
    group_public_key_enc = G.SerializeElement(group_public_key)
    challenge_input = group_comm_enc || group_public_key_enc || msg
    challenge = H2(challenge_input)
    return challenge
~~~

# Two-Round FROST Signing Protocol {#frost-spec}

We now present the two-round variant of the FROST threshold signature protocol for producing Schnorr signatures.
It involves signer participants and a Coordinator. Signer participants are
entities with signing key shares that participate in the threshold signing
protocol. The Coordinator is an entity with the following responsibilities:

1. Determining which signers will participate (at least MIN_SIGNERS in number);
2. Coordinating rounds (receiving and forwarding inputs among participants); and
3. Aggregating signature shares output by each participant, and publishing the resulting signature.

FROST assumes the selection of all participants, including Coordinator and set of
signers, are all chosen external to the protocol. Note that it is possible to
deploy the protocol without a distinguished Coordinator; see {{no-coordinator}}
for more information.

Because key generation is not specified, all signers are assumed to have the (public) group state that we refer to as "group info"
below, and their corresponding signing key shares.

In particular, it is assumed that the Coordinator and each signer participant `P_i` knows the following
group info:

- Group public key, an `Element` in `G`, denoted `PK`, corresponding
  to the group secret key `s`, which is a `Scalar`. `PK` is an output from the group's key generation protocol, such as `trusted_dealer_keygen` or a DKG.
- Public keys for each signer, denoted `PK_i`, which are similarly outputs
  from the group's key generation protocol, `Element` values in `G`.

And that each participant with identifier `i` additionally knows the following:

- Participant `i`s signing key share `sk_i`, which is the i-th secret share of `s`, a `Scalar`.

By construction, `PK = G.ScalarBaseMult(s)` and `PK_i = G.ScalarMultBase(sk_i)` for each participant `i`.

The exact key generation mechanism is out of scope for this specification. In general,
key generation is a protocol that outputs (1) a shared, group public key PK owned
by each Signer, and (2) individual shares of the signing key owned by each Signer.
In general, two possible key generation mechanisms are possible, one that requires
a single, trusted dealer, and the other which requires performing a distributed
key generation protocol. We highlight key generation mechanism by a trusted dealer
in {{dep-dealer}}, for reference.

This signing variant of FROST requires signers to perform two network rounds:
1) generating and publishing commitments, and 2) signature share generation and
publication. The first round serves for each participant to issue a commitment to
a nonce. The second round receives commitments for all signers as well as the message,
and issues a signature share with respect to that message. The Coordinator performs
the coordination of each of these rounds. At the end of the second round, the
Coordinator then performs an aggregation step and outputs the final signature.
This complete interaction is shown in {{fig-frost}}.

{: #fig-frost title="FROST signature overview" }

Details for round one are described in {{frost-round-one}}, and details for round two
are described in {{frost-round-two}}. The final Aggregation step is described in
{{frost-aggregation}}.

FROST assumes that all inputs to each round, especially those of which are received
over the network, are validated before use. In particular, this means that any value
of type Element or Scalar is deserialized using DeserializeElement and DeserializeScalar,
respectively, as these functions perform the necessary input validation steps.

FROST assumes reliable message delivery between the Coordinator and signer participants in
order for the protocol to complete. An attacker masquerading as another participant
will result only in an invalid signature; see {{sec-considerations}}. However, in order
to identify any participant which has misbehaved (resulting in the protocol aborting)
to take actions such as excluding them from future signing operations, we assume that
the network channel is additionally authenticated; confidentiality is not required.

## Round One - Commitment {#frost-round-one}

Round one involves each signer generating nonces and their corresponding public commitments.
A nonce is a pair of Scalar values, and a commitment is a pair of Element values.

Each signer in round one generates a nonce `nonce = (hiding_nonce, binding_nonce)` and commitment
`comm = (hiding_nonce_commitment, binding_nonce_commitment)`.

~~~
  Inputs: sk_i, the secret key share, a Scalar

  Outputs: (nonce, comm), a tuple of nonce and nonce commitment pairs,
    where each value in the nonce pair is a Scalar and each value in
    the nonce commitment pair is an Element

  def commit(sk_i):
    hiding_nonce = nonce_generate(sk_i)
    binding_nonce = nonce_generate(sk_i)
    hiding_nonce_commitment = G.ScalarBaseMult(hiding_nonce)
    binding_nonce_commitment = G.ScalarBaseMult(binding_nonce)
    nonce = (hiding_nonce, binding_nonce)
    comm = (hiding_nonce_commitment, binding_nonce_commitment)
    return (nonce, comm)
~~~

The private output `nonce` from Participant `P_i` is stored locally and kept private
for use in the second round. This nonce MUST NOT be reused in more than one invocation
of FROST, and it MUST be generated from a source of secure randomness. The public output
`comm` from Participant `P_i` is sent to the Coordinator.

<!-- The Coordinator must not get confused about which commitments come from which signers, do we need to say more about how this is done? -->

## Round Two - Signature Share Generation {#frost-round-two}

In round two, the Coordinator is responsible for sending the message to be signed, and
for choosing which signers will participate (of number at least MIN_SIGNERS). Signers
additionally require locally held data; specifically, their private key and the
nonces corresponding to their commitment issued in round one.

The Coordinator begins by sending each signer the message to be signed along with the
set of signing commitments for all signers in the participant list. Each signer
MUST validate the inputs before processing the Coordinator's request. In particular,
the Signer MUST validate commitment_list, deserializing each group Element in the
list using DeserializeElement from {{dep-pog}}. If deserialization fails, the Signer
MUST abort the protocol. Moreover, each signer MUST ensure that their identifier as well as their commitment as from the first round appears in commitment_list.
Applications which require that signers not process arbitrary
input messages are also required to also perform relevant application-layer input
validation checks; see {{message-validation}} for more details.

Upon receipt and successful input validation, each Signer then runs the following
procedure to produce its own signature share.

~~~
  Inputs:
  - identifier, Identifier i of the signer. Note identifier will never equal 0.
  - sk_i, Signer secret key share, a Scalar.
  - group_public_key, public key corresponding to the group signing key,
    an Element in G.
  - nonce_i, pair of Scalar values (hiding_nonce, binding_nonce) generated in
    round one.
  - msg, the message to be signed (sent by the Coordinator).
  - commitment_list =
      [(j, hiding_nonce_commitment_j, binding_nonce_commitment_j), ...], a
    list of commitments issued in Round 1 by each signer and sent by the Coordinator.
    Each element in the list indicates the signer identifier j and their two commitment
    Element values (hiding_nonce_commitment_j, binding_nonce_commitment_j).
    This list MUST be sorted in ascending order by signer identifier.

  Outputs: a Scalar value representing the signature share

  def sign(identifier, sk_i, group_public_key, nonce_i, msg, commitment_list):
    # Compute the binding factor(s)
    binding_factor_list = compute_binding_factors(commitment_list, msg)
    binding_factor = binding_factor_for_participant(binding_factor_list, identifier)

    # Compute the group commitment
    group_commitment = compute_group_commitment(commitment_list, binding_factor_list)

    # Compute Lagrange coefficient
    participant_list = participants_from_commitment_list(commitment_list)
    lambda_i = derive_lagrange_coefficient(identifier, participant_list)

    # Compute the per-message challenge
    challenge = compute_challenge(group_commitment, group_public_key, msg)

    # Compute the signature share
    (hiding_nonce, binding_nonce) = nonce_i
    sig_share = hiding_nonce + (binding_nonce * binding_factor) + (lambda_i * sk_i * challenge)

    return sig_share
~~~

The output of this procedure is a signature share. Each signer then sends
these shares back to the Coordinator. Each signer MUST delete the nonce and
corresponding commitment after this round completes, and MUST use the nonce to generate at most one
signature share.

Note that the `lambda_i` value derived during this procedure does not change
across FROST signing operations for the same signing group. As such, signers
can compute it once and store it for reuse across signing sessions.

Upon receipt from each Signer, the Coordinator MUST validate the input
signature share using DeserializeElement. If validation fails, the Coordinator MUST abort
the protocol. If validation succeeds, the Coordinator then verifies the set of
signature shares using the following procedure.

## Signature Share Verification and Aggregation {#frost-aggregation}

After signers perform round two and send their signature shares to the Coordinator,
the Coordinator verifies each signature share for correctness. In particular,
for each signer, the Coordinator uses commitment pairs generated during round
one and the signature share generated during round two, along with other group
parameters, to check that the signature share is valid using the following procedure.

~~~
  Inputs:
  - identifier, Identifier i of the signer. Note: identifier MUST never equal 0.
  - PK_i, the public key for the ith signer, where PK_i = G.ScalarBaseMult(sk_i),
    an Element in G
  - comm_i, pair of Element values in G (hiding_nonce_commitment, binding_nonce_commitment)
    generated in round one from the ith signer.
  - sig_share_i, a Scalar value indicating the signature share as produced in
    round two from the ith signer.
  - commitment_list =
      [(j, hiding_nonce_commitment_j, binding_nonce_commitment_j), ...], a
    list of commitments issued in Round 1 by each signer, where each element
    in the list indicates the signer identifier j and their two commitment
    Element values (hiding_nonce_commitment_j, binding_nonce_commitment_j).
    This list MUST be sorted in ascending order by signer identifier.
  - group_public_key, public key corresponding to the group signing key,
    an Element in G.
  - msg, the message to be signed.

  Outputs: True if the signature share is valid, and False otherwise.

  def verify_signature_share(identifier, PK_i, comm_i, sig_share_i, commitment_list,
                             group_public_key, msg):
    # Compute the binding factors
    binding_factor_list = compute_binding_factors(commitment_list, msg)
    binding_factor = binding_factor_for_participant(binding_factor_list, identifier)

    # Compute the group commitment
    group_commitment = compute_group_commitment(commitment_list, binding_factor_list)

    # Compute the commitment share
    (hiding_nonce_commitment, binding_nonce_commitment) = comm_i
    comm_share = hiding_nonce_commitment + (binding_nonce_commitment * binding_factor)

    # Compute the challenge
    challenge = compute_challenge(group_commitment, group_public_key, msg)

    # Compute Lagrange coefficient
    participant_list = participants_from_commitment_list(commitment_list)
    lambda_i = derive_lagrange_coefficient(identifier, participant_list)

    # Compute relation values
    l = G.ScalarBaseMult(sig_share_i)
    r = comm_share + ((challenge * lambda_i) * PK_i)

    return l == r
~~~

If any signature share fails to verify, i.e., if verify_signature_share returns False for
any signer share, the Coordinator MUST abort the protocol for correctness reasons.
Excluding one signer means that their nonce will not be included in the joint response `z`
and consequently the output signature will not verify.

Otherwise, if all signer shares are valid, the Coordinator performs the `aggregate` operation
and publishes the resulting signature.

~~~
  Inputs:
  - group_commitment, the group commitment returned by compute_group_commitment,
    an Element in G.
  - sig_shares, a set of signature shares z_i, Scalar values, for each signer,
    of length NUM_SIGNERS, where MIN_SIGNERS <= NUM_SIGNERS <= MAX_SIGNERS.

  Outputs: (R, z), a Schnorr signature consisting of an Element R and Scalar z.

  def aggregate(group_commitment, sig_shares):
    z = 0
    for z_i in sig_shares:
      z = z + z_i
    return (group_commitment, z)
~~~

The output signature (R, z) from the aggregation step MUST be encoded as follows
(using notation from {{Section 3 of TLS}}):

~~~
  struct {
    opaque R_encoded[Ne];
    opaque z_encoded[Ns];
  } Signature;
~~~

Where Signature.R_encoded is `G.SerializeElement(R)` and Signature.z_encoded is
`G.SerializeScalar(z)`.

# Ciphersuites {#ciphersuites}

A FROST ciphersuite must specify the underlying prime-order group details
and cryptographic hash function. Each ciphersuite is denoted as (Group, Hash),
e.g., (ristretto255, SHA-512). This section contains some ciphersuites.

The RECOMMENDED ciphersuite is (ristretto255, SHA-512) {{recommended-suite}}.
The (Ed25519, SHA-512) ciphersuite is included for backwards compatibility
with {{!RFC8032}}.

The DeserializeElement and DeserializeScalar functions instantiated for a
particular prime-order group corresponding to a ciphersuite MUST adhere
to the description in {{dep-pog}}. Validation steps for these functions
are described for each the ciphersuites below. Future ciphersuites MUST
describe how input validation is done for DeserializeElement and DeserializeScalar.

Each ciphersuite includes explicit instructions for verifying signatures produced
by FROST. Note that these instructions are equivalent to those produced by a single
signer.

## FROST(Ed25519, SHA-512)

This ciphersuite uses edwards25519 for the Group and SHA-512 for the Hash function `H`
meant to produce signatures indistinguishable from Ed25519 as specified in {{!RFC8032}}.
The value of the contextString parameter is "FROST-ED25519-SHA512-v8".

- Group: edwards25519 {{!RFC8032}}
  - Order: 2^252 + 27742317777372353535851937790883648493 (see {{?RFC7748}})
  - Identity: As defined in {{RFC7748}}.
  - RandomScalar: Implemented by repeatedly generating a random 32-byte string
    and invoking DeserializeScalar on the result until success.
  - SerializeElement: Implemented as specified in {{!RFC8032, Section 5.1.2}}.
  - DeserializeElement: Implemented as specified in {{!RFC8032, Section 5.1.3}}.
    Additionally, this function validates that the resulting element is not the group
    identity element and is in the prime-order subgroup. The latter check can
    be implemented by multiplying the resulting point by the order of the group and
    checking that the result is the identity element.
  - SerializeScalar: Implemented by outputting the little-endian 32-byte encoding of
    the Scalar value.
  - DeserializeScalar: Implemented by attempting to deserialize a Scalar from a 32-byte
    string. This function can fail if the input does not represent a Scalar between
    the value 0 and `G.Order() - 1`.

- Hash (`H`): SHA-512, and Nh = 64.
  - H1(m): Implemented by computing H("rho" || m), interpreting the 64-byte digest
    as a little-endian integer, and reducing the resulting integer modulo
    L = 2^252+27742317777372353535851937790883648493.
  - H2(m): Implemented by computing H(m), interpreting the 64-byte digest

  - H4(m): Implemented by computing H(contextString \|\| "msg" \|\| m).
  - H5(m): Implemented by computing H(contextString \|\| "com" \|\| m).


Normally H2 would also include a domain separator, but for backwards compatibility
with {{!RFC8032}}, it is omitted.

Signature verification is as specified in {{Section 5.1.7 of RFC8032}} with the
constraint that implementations MUST check the group group equation [8][S]B = [8]R + [8][k]A'.
The alternative check [S]B = R + [k]A' is not safe or interoperable in practice.

# Security Considerations {#sec-considerations}

A security analysis of FROST exists in {{FROST20}} and {{Schnorr21}}. The protocol as specified
in this document assumes the following threat model.

* Trusted dealer. The dealer that performs key generation is trusted to follow
the protocol, although participants still are able to verify the consistency of their
shares via a VSS (verifiable secret sharing) step; see {{dep-vss}}.

* Unforgeability assuming at most `(MIN_SIGNERS-1)` corrupted signers. So long as an adversary
corrupts fewer than `MIN_SIGNERS` participants, the scheme remains secure against Existential
Unforgeability Under Chosen Message Attack (EUF-CMA) attacks, as defined in {{BonehShoup}},
Definition 13.2.

* Coordinator. We assume the Coordinator at the time of signing does not perform a
denial of service attack. A denial of service would include any action which either
prevents the protocol from completing or causing the resulting signature to be invalid.
Such actions for the latter include sending inconsistent values to signer participants,
such as messages or the set of individual commitments. Note that the Coordinator
is *not* trusted with any private information and communication at the time of signing
can be performed over a public but reliable channel.

The protocol as specified in this document does not target the following goals:

* Post quantum security. FROST, like plain Schnorr signatures, requires the hardness of the Discrete Logarithm Problem.
* Robustness. In the case of failure, FROST requires aborting the protocol.
* Downgrade prevention. All participants in the protocol are assumed to agree on what algorithms to use.
* Metadata protection. If protection for metadata is desired, a higher-level communication
channel can be used to facilitate key generation and signing.

The rest of this section documents issues particular to implementations or deployments.

## Nonce Reuse Attacks

Nonces generated by each participant in the first round of signing must be sampled
uniformly at random and cannot be derived from some deterministic function. This
is to avoid replay attacks initiated by other signers, which allows for a complete
key-recovery attack. The Coordinator MAY further hedge against nonce reuse attacks by
tracking signer nonce commitments used for a given group key, at the cost of additional
state.

## Protocol Failures

We do not specify what implementations should do when the protocol fails, other than requiring that
the protocol abort. Examples of viable failure include when a verification check returns invalid or
if the underlying transport failed to deliver the required messages.

## Removing the Coordinator Role {#no-coordinator}

In some settings, it may be desirable to omit the role of the Coordinator entirely.
Doing so does not change the security implications of FROST, but instead simply
requires each participant to communicate with all other participants. We loosely
describe how to perform FROST signing among signers without this coordinator role.
We assume that every participant receives as input from an external source the
message to be signed prior to performing the protocol.

Every participant begins by performing `commit()` as is done in the setting
where a Coordinator is used. However, instead of sending the commitment
to the Coordinator, every participant instead will publish
this commitment to every other participant. Then, in the second round, signers will already have
sufficient information to perform signing. They will directly perform `sign`.
All participants will then publish their signature shares to one another. After having
received all signature shares from all other signers, each signer will then perform
`verify_signature_share` and then `aggregate` directly.

The requirements for the underlying network channel remain the same in the setting
where all participants play the role of the Coordinator, in that all messages that
are exchanged are public and so the channel simply must be reliable. However, in
the setting that a player attempts to split the view of all other players by
sending disjoint values to a subset of players, the signing operation will output
an invalid signature. To avoid this denial of service, implementations may wish
to define a mechanism where messages are authenticated, so that cheating players
can be identified and excluded.

## Input Message Validation {#message-validation}

Some applications may require that signers only process messages of a certain
structure. For example, in digital currency applications wherein multiple
signers may collectively sign a transaction, it is reasonable to require that
each signer check the input message to be a syntactically valid transaction.
As another example, use of threshold signatures in TLS {{?TLS=RFC8446}} to produce
signatures of transcript hashes might require that signers check that the input
message is a valid TLS transcript from which the corresponding transcript hash
can be derived.

In general, input message validation is an application-specific consideration
that varies based on the use case and threat model. However, it is RECOMMENDED
that applications take additional precautions and validate inputs so that signers
do not operate as signing oracles for arbitrary messages.

# Schnorr Signature Verification for Prime-Order Groups {#prime-order-verify}

This section contains a routine for verifying Schnorr signatures with validated inputs.
Specifically, it assumes that signature R component and public key belong to the
prime-order group.

~~~
  prime_order_verify(msg, sig, PK):

  Inputs:
  - msg, signed message, a byte string
  - sig, a tuple (R, z) output from signature generation
  - PK, public key, an Element

  Outputs: 1 if signature is valid, and 0 otherwise

  def prime_order_verify(msg, sig = (R, z), PK):

# Trusted Dealer Key Generation {#dep-dealer}

One possible key generation mechanism is to depend on a trusted dealer, wherein the
dealer generates a group secret `s` uniformly at random and uses Shamir and Verifiable
Secret Sharing as described in {{dep-shamir}} and {{dep-vss}} to create secret
shares of `s` to be sent to all other participants. We highlight at a high level how this
operation can be performed.

The dealer is trusted to 1) generate good randomness, and 2) delete secret values after distributing shares to each participant,
and 3) keep secret values confidential.

~~~
  Inputs:
  - s, a group secret, Scalar, that MUST be derived from at least Ns bytes of entropy
  - MAX_SIGNERS, the number of shares to generate, an integer
  - MIN_SIGNERS, the threshold of the secret sharing scheme, an integer

  Outputs:
  - signer_private_keys, MAX_SIGNERS shares of the secret key s, each a Scalar value.
  - vss_commitment, a vector commitment of Elements in G, to each of the coefficients
    in the polynomial defined by secret_key_shares and whose first element is
    G.ScalarBaseMult(s).

  def trusted_dealer_keygen(s, MAX_SIGNERS, MIN_SIGNERS):
    signer_private_keys, coefficients = secret_share_shard(secret_key, MAX_SIGNERS, MIN_SIGNERS)
    vss_commitment = vss_commit(coefficients):
    PK = G.ScalarBaseMult(secret_key)
    return signer_private_keys, vss_commitment
~~~

It is assumed the dealer then sends one secret key share to each of the NUM_SIGNERS participants, along with `vss_commitment`.
After receiving their secret key share and `vss_commitment`, participants MUST abort if they do not have the same view of `vss_commitment`.
Otherwise, each participant MUST perform `vss_verify(secret_key_share_i, vss_commitment)`, and abort if the check fails.
The trusted dealer MUST delete the secret_key and secret_key_shares upon completion.

Use of this method for key generation requires a mutually authenticated secure channel
between the dealer and participants to send secret key shares, wherein the channel provides confidentiality
and integrity. Mutually authenticated TLS is one possible deployment option.

## Shamir Secret Sharing {#dep-shamir}

In Shamir secret sharing, a dealer distributes a secret `Scalar` `s` to `n` participants
in such a way that any cooperating subset of `MIN_SIGNERS` participants can recover the
secret. There are two basic steps in this scheme: (1) splitting a secret into
multiple shares, and (2) combining shares to reveal the resulting secret.

This secret sharing scheme works over any field `F`. In this specification, `F` is
the scalar field of the prime-order group `G`.

The procedure for splitting a secret into shares is as follows.

~~~
  secret_share_shard(s, MAX_SIGNERS, MIN_SIGNERS):

  Inputs:
  - s, secret value to be shared, a Scalar
  - MAX_SIGNERS, the number of shares to generate, an integer
  - MIN_SIGNERS, the threshold of the secret sharing scheme, an integer

  Outputs:
  - secret_key_shares, A list of MAX_SIGNERS number of secret shares, which is a tuple
    consisting of the participant identifier and the key share, each of which is a Scalar
  - coefficients, a vector of the t coefficients which uniquely determine
    a polynomial f.

  Errors:
  - "invalid parameters", if MIN_SIGNERS > MAX_SIGNERS or if MIN_SIGNERS is less than 2

  def secret_share_shard(s, MAX_SIGNERS, MIN_SIGNERS):
    if MIN_SIGNERS > MAX_SIGNERS:
      raise "invalid parameters"
    if MIN_SIGNERS < 2:
      raise "invalid parameters"

    # Generate random coefficients for the polynomial, yielding
    # a polynomial of degree (MIN_SIGNERS - 1)
    coefficients = [s]
    for i in range(1, MIN_SIGNERS):
      coefficients.append(G.RandomScalar())

    # Evaluate the polynomial for each point x=1,...,n
    secret_key_shares = []
    for x_i in range(1, MAX_SIGNERS + 1):
      y_i = polynomial_evaluate(x_i, coefficients)
      secret_key_share_i = (x_i, y_i)
      secret_key_share.append(secret_key_share_i)
    return secret_key_shares, coefficients
~~~

Let `points` be the output of this function. The i-th element in `points` is
the share for the i-th participant, which is the randomly generated polynomial
evaluated at coordinate `i`. We denote a secret share as the tuple `(i, points[i])`,
and the list of these shares as `shares`.
`i` MUST never equal `0`; recall that `f(0) = s`, where `f` is the polynomial defined in a Shamir secret sharing operation.

The procedure for combining a `shares` list of length `MIN_SIGNERS` to recover the
secret `s` is as follows.

~~~
  secret_share_combine(shares):

  Inputs:
  - shares, a list of at minimum MIN_SIGNERS secret shares, each a tuple (i, f(i))

  Outputs: The resulting secret s, a Scalar, that was previously split into shares

  Errors:
  - "invalid parameters", if less than MIN_SIGNERS input shares are provided

  def secret_share_combine(shares):
    if len(shares) < MIN_SIGNERS:
      raise "invalid parameters"
    s = polynomial_interpolation(shares)
    return s
~~~

## Verifiable Secret Sharing {#dep-vss}

Feldman's Verifiable Secret Sharing (VSS) builds upon Shamir secret sharing,
adding a verification step to demonstrate the consistency of a participant's
share with a public commitment to the polynomial `f` for which the secret `s`
is the constant term. This check ensure that all participants have a point
(their share) on the same polynomial, ensuring that they can later reconstruct
the correct secret.

The procedure for committing to a polynomial `f` of degree `MIN_SIGNERS-1` is as follows.

~~~
  vss_commit(coeffs):

  Inputs:
  - coeffs, a vector of the MIN_SIGNERS coefficients which uniquely determine
  a polynomial f.

  Outputs: a commitment vss_commitment, which is a vector commitment to each of the
  coefficients in coeffs, where each element of the vector commitment is an `Element` in `G`.

  def vss_commit(coeffs):
    vss_commitment = []
    for coeff in coeffs:
      A_i = G.ScalarBaseMult(coeff)
      vss_commitment.append(A_i)
    return vss_commitment
~~~

The procedure for verification of a participant's share is as follows.
If `vss_verify` fails, the participant MUST abort the protocol, and failure should be investigated out of band.

~~~
  vss_verify(share_i, vss_commitment):

  Inputs:
  - share_i: A tuple of the form (i, sk_i), where i indicates the participant
    identifier, and sk_i the participant's secret key, a secret share of the
    constant term of f, where sk_i is a Scalar.
  - vss_commitment: A VSS commitment to a secret polynomial f, a vector commitment
    to each of the coefficients in coeffs, where each element of the vector commitment
    is an Element

  Outputs: 1 if sk_i is valid, and 0 otherwise

  vss_verify(share_i, commitment)
    (i, sk_i) = share_i
    S_i = ScalarBaseMult(sk_i)
    S_i' = G.Identity()
    for j in range(0, MIN_SIGNERS):
      S_i' += pow(i, j) * vss_commitment[j]
    if S_i == S_i':
      return 1
    return 0
~~~

We now define how the Coordinator and signer participants can derive group info,
which is an input into the FROST signing protocol.

~~~
    derive_group_info(MAX_SIGNERS, MIN_SIGNERS, vss_commitment):

    Inputs:
    - MAX_SIGNERS, the number of shares to generate, an integer
    - MIN_SIGNERS, the threshold of the secret sharing scheme, an integer
    - vss_commitment: A VSS commitment to a secret polynomial f, a vector commitment to each of the
    coefficients in coeffs, where each element of the vector commitment is an Element in G.

    Outputs:
    - PK, the public key representing the group, an Element.
    - signer_public_keys, a list of MAX_SIGNERS public keys PK_i for i=1,...,MAX_SIGNERS,
      where each PK_i is the public key, an Element, for participant i.

    derive_group_info(MAX_SIGNERS, MIN_SIGNERS, vss_commitment)
      PK = vss_commitment[0]
      signer_public_keys = []
      for i in range(1, MAX_SIGNERS+1):
        PK_i = G.Identity()
        for j in range(0, MIN_SIGNERS):
          PK_i += pow(i, j) * vss_commitment[j]
        signer_public_keys.append(PK_i)
      return PK, signer_public_keys
~~~

# Test Vectors

This section contains test vectors for all ciphersuites listed in {{ciphersuites}}.
All `Element` and `Scalar` values are represented in serialized form and encoded in
hexadecimal strings. Signatures are represented as the concatenation of their
constituent parts. The input message to be signed is also encoded as a hexadecimal
string.

Each test vector consists of the following information.

- Configuration: This lists the fixed parameters for the particular instantiation
  of FROST, including MAX_SIGNERS, MIN_SIGNERS, and NUM_SIGNERS.
- Group input parameters: This lists the group secret key and shared public key,
  generated by a trusted dealer as described in {{dep-dealer}}, as well as the
  input message to be signed. All values are encoded as hexadecimal strings.
- Signer input parameters: This lists the signing key share for each of the
  NUM_SIGNERS signers.
- Round one parameters and outputs: This lists the NUM_SIGNERS participants engaged
  in the protocol, identified by their integer identifier, the hiding and binding commitment
  values produced in {{frost-round-one}}, as well as the resulting group binding factor input,
  computed in part from the group commitment list encoded as described in {{dep-encoding}},
  and group binding factor as computed in {{frost-round-two}}).
- Round two parameters and outputs: This lists the NUM_SIGNERS participants engaged
  in the protocol, identified by their integer identifier, along with their corresponding
  output signature share as produced in {{frost-round-two}}.
- Final output: This lists the aggregate signature as produced in {{frost-aggregation}}.
