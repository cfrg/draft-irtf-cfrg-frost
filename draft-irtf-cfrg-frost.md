--- abstract

In this draft, we present the two-round signing variant of FROST, a Flexible Round-Optimized
Schnorr Threshold signature scheme. FROST signatures can be issued after a threshold number
of entities cooperate to issue a signature, allowing for improved distribution of trust and
redundancy with respect to a secret key. Further, this draft specifies signatures that are
compatible with {{!RFC8032}}. However, unlike {{!RFC8032}}, the protocol for producing
signatures in this draft is not deterministic, so as to ensure protection against a
key-recovery attack that is possible when even only one signer participant is malicious.

# Introduction

DISCLAIMER: This is a work-in-progress draft of FROST.

RFC EDITOR: PLEASE REMOVE THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH The source for this draft is
maintained in GitHub. Suggested changes should be submitted as pull requests
at https://github.com/cfrg/draft-irtf-cfrg-frost. Instructions are on that page as
well.

Unlike signatures in a single-party setting, threshold signatures
require cooperation among a threshold number of signing participants each holding a share
of a common private key. The security of threshold schemes in general assumes
that an adversary can corrupt strictly fewer than a threshold number of signer participants.

This document presents a variant of a Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold (FROST)
signature scheme originally defined in {{FROST20}}. FROST reduces network overhead during
threshold signing operations while employing a novel technique to protect against forgery
attacks applicable to prior Schnorr-based threshold signature constructions. The variant of
FROST presented in this document requires two rounds to compute a signature. Single-round
signing with FROST is out of scope.

For select ciphersuites, the signatures produced by this draft are compatible with
{{!RFC8032}}. However, unlike {{!RFC8032}}, signatures produced by FROST are not
deterministic, since deriving nonces deterministically allows for a complete key-recovery
attack in multi-party discrete logarithm-based signatures, such as FROST.

While an optimization to FROST was shown in {{Schnorr21}} that reduces scalar multiplications
from linear in the number of signing participants to constant, this draft does not specify that optimization
due to the malleability that this optimization introduces, as shown in {{StrongerSec22}}.
Specifically, this optimization removes the guarantee that the set of signer participants that started
round one of the protocol is the same set of signing participants that produced the signature output by
round two.

Key generation for FROST signing is out of scope for this document. However, for completeness,
key generation with a trusted dealer is specified in {{dep-dealer}}.

# Conventions and Definitions

{::boilerplate bcp14}

The following notation is used throughout the document.

* `random_bytes(n)`: Outputs `n` bytes, sampled uniformly at random
using a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG).
* `count(i, L)`: Outputs the number of times the element `i` is represented in the list `L`.
* `len(l)`: Outputs the length of input list `l`, e.g., `len([1,2,3]) = 3)`.
* `reverse(l)`: Outputs the list `l` in reverse order, e.g., `reverse([1,2,3]) = [3,2,1]`.
* `range(a, b)`: Outputs a list of integers from `a` to `b-1` in ascending order, e.g., `range(1, 4) = [1,2,3]`.
* `pow(a, b)`: Outputs the integer result of `a` to the power of `b`, e.g., `pow(2, 3) = 8`.
* \|\| denotes concatenation of byte strings, i.e., `x || y` denotes the byte string `x`, immediately followed by
  the byte string `y`, with no extra separator, yielding `xy`.
* nil denotes an empty byte string.

Unless otherwise stated, we assume that secrets are sampled uniformly at random
using a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG); see
{{?RFC4086}} for additional guidance on the generation of random numbers.

# Cryptographic Dependencies

FROST signing depends on the following cryptographic constructs:

- Prime-order Group, {{dep-pog}};
- Cryptographic hash function, {{dep-hash}};

These are described in the following sections.

## Prime-Order Group {#dep-pog}

FROST depends on an abelian group of prime order `p`. We represent this
group as the object `G` that additionally defines helper functions described below. The group operation
for `G` is addition `+` with identity element `I`. For any elements `A` and `B` of the group `G`,
`A + B = B + A` is also a member of `G`. Also, for any `A` in `G`, there exists an element
`-A` such that `A + (-A) = (-A) + A = I`. For convenience, we use `-` to denote
subtraction, e.g., `A - B = A + (-B)`. Integers, taken modulo the group order `p`, are called
scalars; arithmetic operations on scalars are implicitly performed modulo `p`. Since `p` is prime,
scalars form a finite field. Scalar multiplication is equivalent to the repeated
application of the group operation on an element `A` with itself `r-1` times, denoted as
`ScalarMult(A, r)`. We denote the sum, difference, and product of two scalars using the `+`, `-`,
and `*` operators, respectively. (Note that this means `+` may refer to group element addition or
scalar addition, depending on types of the operands.) For any element `A`, `ScalarMult(A, p) = I`.
We denote `B` as a fixed generator of the group. Scalar base multiplication is equivalent to the repeated application
of the group operation `B` with itself `r-1` times, this is denoted as `ScalarBaseMult(r)`. The set of
scalars corresponds to `GF(p)`, which we refer to as the scalar field. This document uses types
`Element` and `Scalar` to denote elements of the group `G` and its set of scalars, respectively.
We denote Scalar(x) as the conversion of integer input `x` to the corresponding Scalar value with
the same numeric value. For example, Scalar(1) yields a Scalar representing the value 1.
We denote equality comparison as `==` and assignment of values by `=`.

We now detail a number of member functions that can be invoked on `G`.

- Order(): Outputs the order of `G` (i.e. `p`).
- Identity(): Outputs the identity `Element` of the group (i.e. `I`).
- RandomScalar(): Outputs a random `Scalar` element in GF(p), i.e., a random scalar in \[0, p - 1\].
- ScalarMult(A, k): Output the scalar multiplication between Element `A` and Scalar `k`.
- ScalarBaseMult(k): Output the scalar multiplication between Scalar `k` and the group generator `B`.
- SerializeElement(A): Maps an `Element` `A` to a unique byte array `buf` of fixed length `Ne`.
- DeserializeElement(buf): Attempts to map a byte array `buf` to an `Element` `A`,
  and fails if the input is not a valid byte representation of an element of
  the group. This function can raise a DeserializeError if deserialization fails
  or `A` is the identity element of the group; see {{ciphersuites}} for group-specific
  input validation steps.
- SerializeScalar(s): Maps a Scalar `s` to a unique byte array `buf` of fixed length `Ns`.
- DeserializeScalar(buf): Attempts to map a byte array `buf` to a `Scalar` `s`.
  This function can raise a DeserializeError if deserialization fails; see
  {{ciphersuites}} for group-specific input validation steps.

## Cryptographic Hash Function {#dep-hash}

FROST requires the use of a cryptographically secure hash function, generically
written as H, which functions effectively as a random oracle. For concrete
recommendations on hash functions which SHOULD be used in practice, see
{{ciphersuites}}. Using H, we introduce separate domain-separated hashes,
H1, H2, H3, H4, and H5:

- H1, H2, and H3 map arbitrary byte strings to Scalar elements of the prime-order group scalar field.
- H4 and H5 are aliases for H with distinct domain separators.

The details of H1, H2, H3, H4, and H5 vary based on ciphersuite. See {{ciphersuites}}
for more details about each.

# Helper Functions {#helpers}

Beyond the core dependencies, the protocol in this document depends on the
following helper operations:

- Nonce generation, {{dep-nonces}};
- Polynomial operations, {{dep-polynomial}};
- Encoding operations, {{dep-encoding}};
- Signature binding {{dep-binding-factor}}, group commitment {{dep-group-commit}}, and challenge computation {{dep-sig-challenge}}.

These sections describes these operations in more detail.

## Nonce generation {#dep-nonces}

To hedge against a bad RNG that outputs predictable values, nonces are
generated with the `nonce_generate` function by combining fresh randomness
and with the secret key as input to a domain-separated hash function built
from the ciphersuite hash function `H`. This domain-separated hash function
is denoted `H3`. This function always samples 32 bytes of fresh randomness
to ensure that the probability of nonce reuse is at most 2<sup>-128</sup>
as long as no more than 2<sup>64</sup> signatures are computed by a given
signing participant.

~~~
  nonce_generate(secret):

  Inputs:
  - secret, a Scalar

  Outputs: nonce, a Scalar

  def nonce_generate(secret):
    random_bytes = random_bytes(32)
    secret_enc = G.SerializeScalar(secret)
    return H3(random_bytes || secret_enc)
~~~

## Polynomial Operations {#dep-polynomial}

This section describes operations on and associated with polynomials over Scalars
that are used in the main signing protocol. A polynomial of maximum degree t+1
is represented as a list of t coefficients, where the constant term of the polynomial
is in the first position and the highest-degree coefficient is in the last position.
A point on the polynomial is a tuple (x, y), where `y = f(x)`. For notational
convenience, we refer to the x-coordinate and y-coordinate of a
point p as `p.x` and `p.y`, respectively.

### Evaluation of a polynomial

This section describes a method for evaluating a polynomial `f` at a
particular input `x`, i.e., `y = f(x)` using Horner's method.

~~~
  polynomial_evaluate(x, coeffs):

  Inputs:
  - x, input at which to evaluate the polynomial, a Scalar
  - coeffs, the polynomial coefficients, a list of Scalars

  Outputs: Scalar result of the polynomial evaluated at input x

  def polynomial_evaluate(x, coeffs):
    value = 0
    for coeff in reverse(coeffs):
      value *= x
      value += coeff
    return value
~~~

### Lagrange coefficients

The function `derive_lagrange_coefficient` derives a Lagrange coefficient
to later perform polynomial interpolation, and is provided a list of x-coordinates
as input. Note that `derive_lagrange_coefficient` does not permit any x-coordinate
to equal 0. Lagrange coefficients are used in FROST to evaluate a polynomial `f`
at x-coordinate 0, i.e., `f(0)`, given a list of `t` other x-coordinates.

~~~
  derive_lagrange_coefficient(x_i, L):

  Inputs:
  - x_i, an x-coordinate contained in L, a Scalar
  - L, the set of x-coordinates, each a Scalar

  Outputs: L_i, the i-th Lagrange coefficient

  Errors:
  - "invalid parameters", if 1) any x-coordinate is equal to 0, 2) if x_i
    is not in L, or if 3) any x-coordinate is represented more than once in L.

  def derive_lagrange_coefficient(x_i, L):
    if x_i == 0:
      raise "invalid parameters"
    for x_j in L:
      if x_j == 0:
        raise "invalid parameters"
    if x_i not in L:
      raise "invalid parameters"
    for x_j in L:
      if count(x_i, L) > 1:
        raise "invalid parameters"

    numerator = Scalar(1)
    denominator = Scalar(1)
    for x_j in L:
      if x_j == x_i: continue
      numerator *= x_j
      denominator *= x_j - x_i

    L_i = numerator / denominator
    return L_i
~~~

## List Operations {#dep-encoding}

This section describes helper functions that work on lists of values produced
during the FROST protocol. The following function encodes a list of participant
commitments into a bytestring for use in the FROST protocol.

~~~
  Inputs:
  - commitment_list = [(i, hiding_nonce_commitment_i, binding_nonce_commitment_i), ...],
    a list of commitments issued by each participant, where each element in the list
    indicates the participant identifier i and their two commitment Element values
    (hiding_nonce_commitment_i, binding_nonce_commitment_i). This list MUST be sorted
    in ascending order by participant identifier.

  Outputs: A byte string containing the serialized representation of commitment_list

  def encode_group_commitment_list(commitment_list):
    encoded_group_commitment = nil
    for (identifier, hiding_nonce_commitment, binding_nonce_commitment) in commitment_list:
      encoded_commitment = G.SerializeScalar(identifier) ||
                           G.SerializeElement(hiding_nonce_commitment) ||
                           G.SerializeElement(binding_nonce_commitment)
      encoded_group_commitment = encoded_group_commitment || encoded_commitment
    return encoded_group_commitment
~~~

The following function is used to extract participant identifiers from a commitment
list.

~~~
  Inputs:
  - commitment_list = [(i, hiding_nonce_commitment_i, binding_nonce_commitment_i), ...],
    a list of commitments issued by each participant, where each element in the list
    indicates the participant identifier i and their two commitment Element values
    (hiding_nonce_commitment_i, binding_nonce_commitment_i). This list MUST be sorted
    in ascending order by participant identifier.

  Outputs: A list of participant identifiers

def participants_from_commitment_list(commitment_list):
  identifiers = []
  for (identifier, _, _) in commitment_list:
    identifiers.append(identifier)
  return identifiers
~~~

The following function is used to extract a binding factor from a list of binding factors.

~~~
  Inputs:
  - binding_factor_list = [(i, binding_factor), ...],
    a list of binding factors for each participant, where each element in the list
    indicates the participant identifier i and their binding factor. This list MUST be sorted
    in ascending order by participant identifier.
  - identifier, participant identifier, a Scalar.

  Outputs: A Scalar value.

  Errors: "invalid participant", when the designated participant is not known

def binding_factor_for_participant(binding_factor_list, identifier):
  for (i, binding_factor) in binding_factor_list:
    if identifier == i:
      return binding_factor
  raise "invalid participant"
~~~

## Binding Factors Computation {#dep-binding-factor}

This section describes the subroutine for computing binding factors based
on the participant commitment list and message to be signed.

~~~
  Inputs:
  - commitment_list = [(i, hiding_nonce_commitment_i, binding_nonce_commitment_i), ...],
    a list of commitments issued by each participant, where each element in the list
    indicates the participant identifier i and their two commitment Element values
    (hiding_nonce_commitment_i, binding_nonce_commitment_i). This list MUST be sorted
    in ascending order by participant identifier.
  - msg, the message to be signed.

  Outputs: A list of (identifier, Scalar) tuples representing the binding factors.

  def compute_binding_factors(commitment_list, msg):
    msg_hash = H4(msg)
    encoded_commitment_hash = H5(encode_group_commitment_list(commitment_list))
    rho_input_prefix = msg_hash || encoded_commitment_hash

    binding_factor_list = []
    for (identifier, hiding_nonce_commitment, binding_nonce_commitment) in commitment_list:
      rho_input = rho_input_prefix || G.SerializeScalar(identifier)
      binding_factor = H1(rho_input)
      binding_factor_list.append((identifier, binding_factor))
    return binding_factor_list
~~~

## Group Commitment Computation {#dep-group-commit}

This section describes the subroutine for creating the group commitment
from a commitment list.

~~~
  Inputs:
  - commitment_list =
     [(i, hiding_nonce_commitment_i, binding_nonce_commitment_i), ...], a list
    of commitments issued by each participant, where each element in the list
    indicates the participant identifier i and their two commitment Element values
    (hiding_nonce_commitment_i, binding_nonce_commitment_i). This list MUST be
    sorted in ascending order by participant identifier.
  - binding_factor_list = [(i, binding_factor), ...],
    a list of (identifier, Scalar) tuples representing the binding factor Scalar
    for the given identifier. This list MUST be sorted in ascending order by identifier.

  Outputs: An Element in G representing the group commitment

  def compute_group_commitment(commitment_list, binding_factor_list):
    group_commitment = G.Identity()
    for (identifier, hiding_nonce_commitment, binding_nonce_commitment) in commitment_list:
      binding_factor = binding_factor_for_participant(binding_factors, identifier)
      group_commitment = group_commitment +
        hiding_nonce_commitment + G.ScalarMult(binding_nonce_commitment, binding_factor)
    return group_commitment
~~~

## Signature Challenge Computation {#dep-sig-challenge}

This section describes the subroutine for creating the per-message challenge.

~~~
  Inputs:
  - group_commitment, an Element in G representing the group commitment
  - group_public_key, public key corresponding to the group signing key, an
    Element in G.
  - msg, the message to be signed.

  Outputs: A Scalar representing the challenge

  def compute_challenge(group_commitment, group_public_key, msg):
    group_comm_enc = G.SerializeElement(group_commitment)

    challenge_input = group_comm_enc || group_public_key_enc || msg
    challenge = H2(challenge_input)
    return challenge
~~~

# Two-Round FROST Signing Protocol {#frost-spec}

This section describes the two-round variant of the FROST threshold signature
protocol for producing Schnorr signatures. The protocol is configured to
run with a selection of `NUM_PARTICIPANTS` signer participants and a Coordinator.
`NUM_PARTICIPANTS` is a positive integer at least `MIN_PARTICIPANTS` but no larger than
`MAX_PARTICIPANTS`, where `MIN_PARTICIPANTS < MAX_PARTICIPANTS`, `MIN_PARTICIPANTS` is a positive
integer and `MAX_PARTICIPANTS` is a positive integer less than the group order.
A signer participant, or simply participant, is an entity that is trusted to hold and
use a signing key share. The Coordinator is an entity with the following responsibilities:

1. Determining which participants will participate (at least MIN_PARTICIPANTS in number);
2. Coordinating rounds (receiving and forwarding inputs among participants); and
3. Aggregating signature shares output by each participant, and publishing the resulting signature.

FROST assumes that all participants, including the Coordinator and the set of participants,
are chosen externally to the protocol. Note that it is possible to deploy the protocol
without a distinguished Coordinator; see {{no-coordinator}} for more information.

FROST produces signatures that are indistinguishable from those produced with a single
participant using a signing key `s` with corresponding public key `PK`, where `s` is a Scalar
value and `PK = G.ScalarMultBase(s)`. As a threshold signing protocol, the group signing
key `s` is secret-shared amongst each participant and used to produce signatures. In particular,
FROST assumes each participant is configured with the following information:

- An identifier, which is a Scalar value denoted `i` in the range `[1, MAX_PARTICIPANTS]`
  and MUST be distinct from the identifier of every other participant.
- A signing key share `sk_i`, which is a Scalar value representing the i-th secret share
  of the group signing key `s`. The public key corresponding to this signing key share
  is `PK_i = G.ScalarMultBase(sk_i)`.

Each participant, including the Coordinator, is additionally configured
with common group information, denoted "group info," which consists of the following
information:

- Group public key, which is an `Element` in `G` denoted `PK`.
- Public keys `PK_i` for each signer, which are `Element` values in `G` denoted `PK_i`
  for each `i` in `[1, MAX_PARTICIPANTS]`.

This document does not specify how this information, including the signing key shares,
are configured and distributed to participants. In general, two possible configuration
mechanisms are possible: one that requires a single, trusted dealer, and the other
which requires performing a distributed key generation protocol. We highlight
key generation mechanism by a trusted dealer in {{dep-dealer}} for reference.

The signing variant of FROST in this document requires participants to perform two network rounds:
1) generating and publishing commitments, and 2) signature share generation and
publication. The first round serves for each participant to issue a commitment to
a nonce. The second round receives commitments for all participants as well as the message,
and issues a signature share with respect to that message. The Coordinator performs
the coordination of each of these rounds. At the end of the second round, the
Coordinator then performs an aggregation step and outputs the final signature.
This complete interaction is shown in {{fig-frost}}.

{: #fig-frost title="FROST signature overview" }

Details for round one are described in {{frost-round-one}}, and details for round two
are described in {{frost-round-two}}. Note that each participant persists some state between
both rounds, and this state is deleted as described in {{frost-round-two}}. The final
Aggregation step is described in {{frost-aggregation}}.

FROST assumes that all inputs to each round, especially those of which are received
over the network, are validated before use. In particular, this means that any value
of type Element or Scalar is deserialized using DeserializeElement and DeserializeScalar,
respectively, as these functions perform the necessary input validation steps.

FROST assumes reliable message delivery between the Coordinator and participants in
order for the protocol to complete. An attacker masquerading as another participant
will result only in an invalid signature; see {{sec-considerations}}. However, in order
to identify any participant which has misbehaved (resulting in the protocol aborting)
to take actions such as excluding them from future signing operations, we assume that
the network channel is additionally authenticated; confidentiality is not required.

## Round One - Commitment {#frost-round-one}

Round one involves each participant generating nonces and their corresponding public commitments.
A nonce is a pair of Scalar values, and a commitment is a pair of Element values. Each participant's
behavior in this round is described by the `commit` function below. Note that this function
invokes `nonce_generate` twice, once for each type of nonce produced. The output of this function is
a pair of secret nonces `(hiding_nonce, binding_nonce)` and their corresponding public commitments
`(hiding_nonce_commitment, binding_nonce_commitment)`.

~~~
  Inputs: sk_i, the secret key share, a Scalar

  Outputs: (nonce, comm), a tuple of nonce and nonce commitment pairs,
    where each value in the nonce pair is a Scalar and each value in
    the nonce commitment pair is an Element

  def commit(sk_i):
    hiding_nonce = nonce_generate(sk_i)
    binding_nonce = nonce_generate(sk_i)
    hiding_nonce_commitment = G.ScalarBaseMult(hiding_nonce)
    binding_nonce_commitment = G.ScalarBaseMult(binding_nonce)
    nonce = (hiding_nonce, binding_nonce)
    comm = (hiding_nonce_commitment, binding_nonce_commitment)
    return (nonce, comm)
~~~

The outputs `nonce` and `comm` from participant `P_i` should both be stored locally and
kept for use in the second round. The `nonce` value is secret and MUST NOT be shared, whereas
the public output `comm` is sent to the Coordinator. The nonce values produced by this
function MUST NOT be reused in more than one invocation of FROST, and it MUST be generated
from a source of secure randomness.

<!-- The Coordinator must not get confused about which commitments come from which signers, do we need to say more about how this is done? -->

## Round Two - Signature Share Generation {#frost-round-two}

In round two, the Coordinator is responsible for sending the message to be signed, and
for choosing which participants will participate (of number at least MIN_PARTICIPANTS). Signers
additionally require locally held data; specifically, their private key and the
nonces corresponding to their commitment issued in round one.

The Coordinator begins by sending each participant the message to be signed along with the
set of signing commitments for all participants in the participant list. Each participant
MUST validate the inputs before processing the Coordinator's request. In particular,
the Signer MUST validate commitment_list, deserializing each group Element in the
list using DeserializeElement from {{dep-pog}}. If deserialization fails, the Signer
MUST abort the protocol. Moreover, each participant MUST ensure that their identifier as
well as their commitment as from the first round appears in commitment_list.
Applications which require that participants not process arbitrary
input messages are also required to also perform relevant application-layer input
validation checks; see {{message-validation}} for more details.

Upon receipt and successful input validation, each Signer then runs the following
procedure to produce its own signature share.

~~~
  Inputs:
  - identifier, Identifier i of the participant. Note identifier will never equal 0.
  - sk_i, Signer secret key share, a Scalar.
  - group_public_key, public key corresponding to the group signing key,
    an Element in G.
  - nonce_i, pair of Scalar values (hiding_nonce, binding_nonce) generated in
    round one.
  - msg, the message to be signed (sent by the Coordinator).
  - commitment_list =
      [(j, hiding_nonce_commitment_j, binding_nonce_commitment_j), ...], a
    list of commitments issued in Round 1 by each participant and sent by the Coordinator.
    Each element in the list indicates the participant identifier j and their two commitment
    Element values (hiding_nonce_commitment_j, binding_nonce_commitment_j).
    This list MUST be sorted in ascending order by participant identifier.

  Outputs: a Scalar value representing the signature share

  def sign(identifier, sk_i, group_public_key, nonce_i, msg, commitment_list):
    # Compute the binding factor(s)
    binding_factor_list = compute_binding_factors(commitment_list, msg)
    binding_factor = binding_factor_for_participant(binding_factor_list, identifier)

    # Compute the group commitment
    group_commitment = compute_group_commitment(commitment_list, binding_factor_list)

    # Compute Lagrange coefficient
    participant_list = participants_from_commitment_list(commitment_list)
    lambda_i = derive_lagrange_coefficient(identifier, participant_list)

    # Compute the per-message challenge
    challenge = compute_challenge(group_commitment, group_public_key, msg)

    # Compute the signature share
    (hiding_nonce, binding_nonce) = nonce_i
    sig_share = hiding_nonce + (binding_nonce * binding_factor) + (lambda_i * sk_i * challenge)

    return sig_share
~~~

The output of this procedure is a signature share. Each participant then sends
these shares back to the Coordinator. Each participant MUST delete the nonce and
corresponding commitment after this round completes, and MUST use the nonce
to generate at most one signature share.

Note that the `lambda_i` value derived during this procedure does not change
across FROST signing operations for the same signing group. As such, participants
can compute it once and store it for reuse across signing sessions.

Upon receipt from each Signer, the Coordinator MUST validate the input
signature share using DeserializeElement. If validation fails, the Coordinator MUST abort
the protocol. If validation succeeds, the Coordinator then verifies the set of
signature shares using the following procedure.

## Signature Share Verification and Aggregation {#frost-aggregation}

After participants perform round two and send their signature shares to the Coordinator,
the Coordinator verifies each signature share for correctness. In particular,
for each participant, the Coordinator uses commitment pairs generated during round
one and the signature share generated during round two, along with other group
parameters, to check that the signature share is valid using the following procedure.

~~~
  Inputs:
  - identifier, Identifier i of the participant. Note: identifier MUST never equal 0.
  - PK_i, the public key for the ith participant, where PK_i = G.ScalarBaseMult(sk_i),
    an Element in G
  - comm_i, pair of Element values in G (hiding_nonce_commitment, binding_nonce_commitment)
    generated in round one from the ith participant.
  - sig_share_i, a Scalar value indicating the signature share as produced in
    round two from the ith participant.
  - commitment_list =
      [(j, hiding_nonce_commitment_j, binding_nonce_commitment_j), ...], a
    list of commitments issued in Round 1 by each participant, where each element
    in the list indicates the participant identifier j and their two commitment
    Element values (hiding_nonce_commitment_j, binding_nonce_commitment_j).
    This list MUST be sorted in ascending order by participant identifier.
  - group_public_key, public key corresponding to the group signing key,
    an Element in G.
  - msg, the message to be signed.

  Outputs: True if the signature share is valid, and False otherwise.

  def verify_signature_share(identifier, PK_i, comm_i, sig_share_i, commitment_list,
                             group_public_key, msg):
    # Compute the binding factors
    binding_factor_list = compute_binding_factors(commitment_list, msg)
    binding_factor = binding_factor_for_participant(binding_factor_list, identifier)

    # Compute the group commitment
    group_commitment = compute_group_commitment(commitment_list, binding_factor_list)

    # Compute the commitment share
    (hiding_nonce_commitment, binding_nonce_commitment) = comm_i
    comm_share = hiding_nonce_commitment + G.ScalarMult(binding_nonce_commitment, binding_factor)

    # Compute the challenge
    challenge = compute_challenge(group_commitment, group_public_key, msg)

    # Compute Lagrange coefficient
    participant_list = participants_from_commitment_list(commitment_list)
    lambda_i = derive_lagrange_coefficient(identifier, participant_list)

    # Compute relation values
    l = G.ScalarBaseMult(sig_share_i)
    r = comm_share + G.ScalarMult(PK_i, challenge * lambda_i)

    return l == r
~~~

If any signature share fails to verify, i.e., if verify_signature_share returns False for
any participant share, the Coordinator MUST abort the protocol for correctness reasons
(this is true regardless of the size or makeup of the signing set selected by
the Coordinator).
Excluding one participant means that their nonce will not be included in the joint response `z`
and consequently the output signature will not verify. This is because the
group commitment will be with respect to a different signing set than the
the aggregated response.

Otherwise, if all shares from participants that participated in Rounds 1 and 2 are valid, the Coordinator
performs the `aggregate` operation and publishes the resulting signature.

~~~
  Inputs:
  - group_commitment, the group commitment returned by compute_group_commitment,
    an Element in G.
  - sig_shares, a set of signature shares z_i, Scalar values, for each participant,
    of length NUM_PARTICIPANTS, where MIN_PARTICIPANTS <= NUM_PARTICIPANTS <= MAX_PARTICIPANTS.

  Outputs: (R, z), a Schnorr signature consisting of an Element R and Scalar z.

  def aggregate(group_commitment, sig_shares):
    z = 0
    for z_i in sig_shares:
      z = z + z_i
    return (group_commitment, z)
~~~

The output signature (R, z) from the aggregation step MUST be encoded as follows
(using notation from {{Section 3 of TLS}}):

~~~
  struct {
    opaque R_encoded[Ne];
    opaque z_encoded[Ns];
  } Signature;
~~~

Where Signature.R_encoded is `G.SerializeElement(R)` and Signature.z_encoded is
`G.SerializeScalar(z)`.

# Ciphersuites {#ciphersuites}

A FROST ciphersuite must specify the underlying prime-order group details
and cryptographic hash function. Each ciphersuite is denoted as (Group, Hash),
e.g., (ristretto255, SHA-512). This section contains some ciphersuites.
Each ciphersuite also includes a context string, denoted `contextString`,
which is an ASCII string literal (with no NULL terminating character).

The RECOMMENDED ciphersuite is (ristretto255, SHA-512) {{recommended-suite}}.
The (Ed25519, SHA-512) ciphersuite is included for backwards compatibility
with {{!RFC8032}}.

The DeserializeElement and DeserializeScalar functions instantiated for a
particular prime-order group corresponding to a ciphersuite MUST adhere
to the description in {{dep-pog}}. Validation steps for these functions
are described for each the ciphersuites below. Future ciphersuites MUST
describe how input validation is done for DeserializeElement and DeserializeScalar.

Each ciphersuite includes explicit instructions for verifying signatures produced
by FROST. Note that these instructions are equivalent to those produced by a single
participant.

## FROST(Ed25519, SHA-512)

This ciphersuite uses edwards25519 for the Group and SHA-512 for the Hash function `H`
meant to produce signatures indistinguishable from Ed25519 as specified in {{!RFC8032}}.

with {{!RFC8032}}, it is omitted.

Signature verification is as specified in {{Section 5.1.7 of RFC8032}} with the
constraint that implementations MUST check the group equation [8][S]B = [8]R + [8][k]A'.

# Security Considerations {#sec-considerations}

A security analysis of FROST exists in {{FROST20}} and {{Schnorr21}}. The protocol as specified
in this document assumes the following threat model.

* Trusted dealer. The dealer that performs key generation is trusted to follow
the protocol, although participants still are able to verify the consistency of their
shares via a VSS (verifiable secret sharing) step; see {{dep-vss}}.

* Unforgeability assuming at most `(MIN_PARTICIPANTS-1)` corrupted participants. So long as an adversary
corrupts fewer than `MIN_PARTICIPANTS` participants, the scheme remains secure against Existential
Unforgeability Under Chosen Message Attack (EUF-CMA) attacks, as defined in {{BonehShoup}},
Definition 13.2.

* Coordinator. We assume the Coordinator at the time of signing does not perform a
denial of service attack. A denial of service would include any action which either
prevents the protocol from completing or causing the resulting signature to be invalid.
Such actions for the latter include sending inconsistent values to participants,
such as messages or the set of individual commitments. Note that the Coordinator
is *not* trusted with any private information and communication at the time of signing
can be performed over a public but reliable channel.

The protocol as specified in this document does not target the following goals:

* Post quantum security. FROST, like plain Schnorr signatures, requires the hardness of the Discrete Logarithm Problem.
* Robustness. In the case of failure, FROST requires aborting the protocol.
* Downgrade prevention. All participants in the protocol are assumed to agree on what algorithms to use.
* Metadata protection. If protection for metadata is desired, a higher-level communication
channel can be used to facilitate key generation and signing.

The rest of this section documents issues particular to implementations or deployments.

## Nonce Reuse Attacks

{{dep-nonces}} describes the procedure that participants use to produce nonces during
the first round of singing. The randomness produced in this procedure MUST be sampled
uniformly at random. The resulting nonces produced via `nonce_generate` are indistinguishable
from values sampled uniformly at random. This requirement is necessary to avoid
replay attacks initiated by other participants, which allow for a complete key-recovery attack.
The Coordinator MAY further hedge against nonce reuse attacks by tracking participant nonce
commitments used for a given group key, at the cost of additional state.

## Protocol Failures

We do not specify what implementations should do when the protocol fails, other than requiring that
the protocol abort. Examples of viable failure include when a verification check returns invalid or
if the underlying transport failed to deliver the required messages.

## Removing the Coordinator Role {#no-coordinator}

In some settings, it may be desirable to omit the role of the Coordinator entirely.
Doing so does not change the security implications of FROST, but instead simply
requires each participant to communicate with all other participants. We loosely
describe how to perform FROST signing among participants without this coordinator role.
We assume that every participant receives as input from an external source the
message to be signed prior to performing the protocol.

Every participant begins by performing `commit()` as is done in the setting
where a Coordinator is used. However, instead of sending the commitment
to the Coordinator, every participant instead will publish
this commitment to every other participant. Then, in the second round, participants will already have
sufficient information to perform signing. They will directly perform `sign()`.
All participants will then publish their signature shares to one another. After having
received all signature shares from all other participants, each participant will then perform
`verify_signature_share` and then `aggregate` directly.

The requirements for the underlying network channel remain the same in the setting
where all participants play the role of the Coordinator, in that all messages that
are exchanged are public and so the channel simply must be reliable. However, in
the setting that a player attempts to split the view of all other players by
sending disjoint values to a subset of players, the signing operation will output
an invalid signature. To avoid this denial of service, implementations may wish
to define a mechanism where messages are authenticated, so that cheating players
can be identified and excluded.

## Input Message Hashing {#pre-hashing}

FROST signatures do not pre-hash message inputs. This means that the entire message
must be known in advance of invoking the signing protocol. Applications can apply
pre-hashing in settings where storing the full message is prohibitively expensive.
In such cases, pre-hashing MUST use a collision-resistant hash function with a security
level commensurate with the security in inherent to the ciphersuite chosen. It is
RECOMMENDED that applications which choose to apply pre-hashing use the hash function
(`H`) associated with the chosen ciphersuite in a manner similar to how `H4` is defined.
In particular, a different prefix SHOULD be used to differentiate this pre-hash from
`H4`. One possible example is to construct this pre-hash over message `m` as
`H(contextString \|\| "pre-hash" \|\| m)`.

## Input Message Validation {#message-validation}

Some applications may require that participants only process messages of a certain
structure. For example, in digital currency applications wherein multiple
participants may collectively sign a transaction, it is reasonable to require that
each participant check the input message to be a syntactically valid transaction.

As another example, use of threshold signatures in {{?TLS=RFC8446}} to produce
signatures of transcript hashes might require the participants receive the source
handshake messages themselves, and recompute the transcript hash which is used
as input message to the signature generation process, so that they can verify
that they are signing a proper TLS transcript hash and not some other data.

In general, input message validation is an application-specific consideration
that varies based on the use case and threat model. However, it is RECOMMENDED
that applications take additional precautions and validate inputs so that participants
do not operate as signing oracles for arbitrary messages.

# Schnorr Signature Verification for Prime-Order Groups {#prime-order-verify}

This section contains a routine for verifying Schnorr signatures with validated inputs.
Specifically, it assumes that signature R component and public key belong to the
prime-order group.

~~~
  prime_order_verify(msg, sig, PK):

  Inputs:
  - msg, signed message, a byte string
  - sig, a tuple (R, z) output from signature generation
  - PK, public key, an Element

  Outputs: 1 if signature is valid, and 0 otherwise

  def prime_order_verify(msg, sig = (R, z), PK):
    comm_enc = G.SerializeElement(R)
    pk_enc = G.SerializeElement(PK)
    challenge_input = comm_enc || pk_enc || msg
    c = H2(challenge_input)

    l = G.ScalarBaseMult(z)
    r = R + G.ScalarMult(PK, c)
    return l == r
~~~

# Trusted Dealer Key Generation {#dep-dealer}

One possible key generation mechanism is to depend on a trusted dealer, wherein the
dealer generates a group secret `s` uniformly at random and uses Shamir and Verifiable
Secret Sharing as described in {{dep-shamir}} and {{dep-vss}} to create secret
shares of s, denoted `s_i` for `i = 0, ..., MAX_PARTICIPANTS`, to be sent to all `MAX_PARTICIPANTS` participants.
This operation is specified in the `trusted_dealer_keygen` algorithm. The mathematical relation
between the secret key `s` and the `MAX_SIGNER` secret shares is formalized in the `secret_share_combine(shares)`
algorithm, defined in {{dep-shamir}}.

The dealer that performs `trusted_dealer_keygen` is trusted to 1) generate good randomness, and 2) delete secret values after distributing shares to each participant, and 3) keep secret values confidential.

~~~
  Inputs:
  - secret_key, a group secret, a Scalar, that MUST be derived from at least Ns bytes of entropy
  - MAX_PARTICIPANTS, the number of shares to generate, an integer
  - MIN_PARTICIPANTS, the threshold of the secret sharing scheme, an integer

  Outputs:
  - participant_private_keys, MAX_PARTICIPANTS shares of the secret key s, each a tuple
    consisting of the participant identifier and the key share (a Scalar).
  - vss_commitment, a vector commitment of Elements in G, to each of the coefficients
    in the polynomial defined by secret_key_shares and whose first element is
    G.ScalarBaseMult(s).

  def trusted_dealer_keygen(secret_key, MAX_PARTICIPANTS, MIN_PARTICIPANTS):
    participant_private_keys, coefficients = secret_share_shard(secret_key, MAX_PARTICIPANTS, MIN_PARTICIPANTS)
    vss_commitment = vss_commit(coefficients):
    PK = G.ScalarBaseMult(secret_key)
    return participant_private_keys, vss_commitment
~~~

It is assumed the dealer then sends one secret key share to each of the `NUM_PARTICIPANTS` participants, along with `vss_commitment`.
After receiving their secret key share and `vss_commitment`, participants MUST abort if they do not have the same view of `vss_commitment`.
Otherwise, each participant MUST perform `vss_verify(secret_key_share_i, vss_commitment)`, and abort if the check fails.
The trusted dealer MUST delete the secret_key and secret_key_shares upon completion.

Use of this method for key generation requires a mutually authenticated secure channel
between the dealer and participants to send secret key shares, wherein the channel provides confidentiality
and integrity. Mutually authenticated TLS is one possible deployment option.

## Shamir Secret Sharing {#dep-shamir}

In Shamir secret sharing, a dealer distributes a secret `Scalar` `s` to `n` participants
in such a way that any cooperating subset of `MIN_PARTICIPANTS` participants can recover the
secret. There are two basic steps in this scheme: (1) splitting a secret into
multiple shares, and (2) combining shares to reveal the resulting secret.

This secret sharing scheme works over any field `F`. In this specification, `F` is
the scalar field of the prime-order group `G`.

The procedure for splitting a secret into shares is as follows.

~~~
  secret_share_shard(s, MAX_PARTICIPANTS, MIN_PARTICIPANTS):

  Inputs:
  - s, secret value to be shared, a Scalar
  - MAX_PARTICIPANTS, the number of shares to generate, an integer less than 2^16
  - MIN_PARTICIPANTS, the threshold of the secret sharing scheme, an integer greater than 0

  Outputs:
  - secret_key_shares, A list of MAX_PARTICIPANTS number of secret shares, each a tuple
    consisting of the participant identifier and the key share (a Scalar)
  - coefficients, a vector of MIN_PARTICIPANTS coefficients which uniquely determine a polynomial f.

  Errors:
  - "invalid parameters", if MIN_PARTICIPANTS > MAX_PARTICIPANTS or if MIN_PARTICIPANTS is less than 2

  def secret_share_shard(s, MAX_PARTICIPANTS, MIN_PARTICIPANTS):
    if MIN_PARTICIPANTS > MAX_PARTICIPANTS:
      raise "invalid parameters"
    if MIN_PARTICIPANTS < 2:
      raise "invalid parameters"

    # Generate random coefficients for the polynomial, yielding
    # a polynomial of degree at most (MIN_PARTICIPANTS - 1)
    coefficients = [s]
    for i in range(1, MIN_PARTICIPANTS):
      coefficients.append(G.RandomScalar())

    # Evaluate the polynomial for each point x=1,...,n
    secret_key_shares = []
    for x_i in range(1, MAX_PARTICIPANTS + 1):
      y_i = polynomial_evaluate(Scalar(x_i), coefficients)
      secret_key_share_i = (x_i, y_i)
      secret_key_share.append(secret_key_share_i)
    return secret_key_shares, coefficients
~~~

Let `points` be the output of this function. The i-th element in `points` is
the share for the i-th participant, which is the randomly generated polynomial
evaluated at coordinate `i`. We denote a secret share as the tuple `(i, points[i])`,
and the list of these shares as `shares`.
`i` MUST never equal `0`; recall that `f(0) = s`, where `f` is the polynomial defined in a Shamir secret sharing operation.

The procedure for combining a `shares` list of length `MIN_PARTICIPANTS` to recover the
secret `s` is as follows; the algorithm `polynomial_interpolation is defined in {{dep-polynomial-interpolate}}`.

~~~
  secret_share_combine(shares):

  Inputs:
  - shares, a list of at minimum MIN_PARTICIPANTS secret shares, each a tuple (i, f(i))
    where i and f(i) are Scalars

  Outputs: The resulting secret s, a Scalar, that was previously split into shares

  Errors:
  - "invalid parameters", if fewer than MIN_PARTICIPANTS input shares are provided

  def secret_share_combine(shares):
    if len(shares) < MIN_PARTICIPANTS:
      raise "invalid parameters"
    s = polynomial_interpolation(shares)
    return s
~~~

### Deriving the constant term of a polynomial  {#dep-polynomial-interpolate}

Secret sharing requires "splitting" a secret, which is represented as
a constant term of some polynomial `f` of degree `t-1`. Recovering the
constant term occurs with a set of `t` points using polynomial
interpolation, defined as follows.

~~~
  Inputs:
  - points, a set of t distinct points on a polynomial f, each a tuple of two
    Scalar values representing the x and y coordinates

  Outputs: The constant term of f, i.e., f(0)

  def polynomial_interpolation(points):
    x_coords = []
    for point in points:
      x_coords.append(point.x)

    f_zero = Scalar(0)
    for point in points:
      delta = point.y * derive_lagrange_coefficient(point.x, x_coords)
      f_zero = f_zero + delta

    return f_zero
~~~

## Verifiable Secret Sharing {#dep-vss}

Feldman's Verifiable Secret Sharing (VSS) builds upon Shamir secret sharing,
adding a verification step to demonstrate the consistency of a participant's
share with a public commitment to the polynomial `f` for which the secret `s`
is the constant term. This check ensures that all participants have a point
(their share) on the same polynomial, ensuring that they can later reconstruct
the correct secret.

The procedure for committing to a polynomial `f` of degree at most `MIN_PARTICIPANTS-1` is as follows.

~~~
  vss_commit(coeffs):

  Inputs:
  - coeffs, a vector of the MIN_PARTICIPANTS coefficients which uniquely determine
  a polynomial f.

  Outputs: a commitment vss_commitment, which is a vector commitment to each of the
  coefficients in coeffs, where each element of the vector commitment is an Element in G.

  def vss_commit(coeffs):
    vss_commitment = []
    for coeff in coeffs:
      A_i = G.ScalarBaseMult(coeff)
      vss_commitment.append(A_i)
    return vss_commitment
~~~

The procedure for verification of a participant's share is as follows.
If `vss_verify` fails, the participant MUST abort the protocol, and failure should be investigated out of band.

~~~
  vss_verify(share_i, vss_commitment):

  Inputs:
  - share_i: A tuple of the form (i, sk_i), where i indicates the participant
    identifier, and sk_i the participant's secret key, a secret share of the
    constant term of f, where sk_i is a Scalar.
  - vss_commitment: A VSS commitment to a secret polynomial f, a vector commitment
    to each of the coefficients in coeffs, where each element of the vector commitment
    is an Element

  Outputs: 1 if sk_i is valid, and 0 otherwise

  vss_verify(share_i, commitment)
    (i, sk_i) = share_i
    S_i = ScalarBaseMult(sk_i)
    S_i' = G.Identity()
    for j in range(0, MIN_PARTICIPANTS):
      S_i' += G.ScalarMult(vss_commitment[j], pow(i, j))
    if S_i == S_i':
      return 1
    return 0
~~~

We now define how the Coordinator and participants can derive group info,
which is an input into the FROST signing protocol.

~~~
    derive_group_info(MAX_PARTICIPANTS, MIN_PARTICIPANTS, vss_commitment):

    Inputs:
    - MAX_PARTICIPANTS, the number of shares to generate, an integer
    - MIN_PARTICIPANTS, the threshold of the secret sharing scheme, an integer
    - vss_commitment: A VSS commitment to a secret polynomial f, a vector commitment to each of the
    coefficients in coeffs, where each element of the vector commitment is an Element in G.

    Outputs:
    - PK, the public key representing the group, an Element.
    - participant_public_keys, a list of MAX_PARTICIPANTS public keys PK_i for i=1,...,MAX_PARTICIPANTS,
      where each PK_i is the public key, an Element, for participant i.

    derive_group_info(MAX_PARTICIPANTS, MIN_PARTICIPANTS, vss_commitment)
      PK = vss_commitment[0]
      participant_public_keys = []
      for i in range(1, MAX_PARTICIPANTS+1):
        PK_i = G.Identity()
        for j in range(0, MIN_PARTICIPANTS):
          PK_i += G.ScalarMult(vss_commitment[j], pow(i, j))
        participant_public_keys.append(PK_i)
      return PK, participant_public_keys
~~~

# Random Scalar Generation {#random-scalar}

Two popular algorithms for generating a random integer uniformly distributed in
the range \[0, G.Order() -1\] are as follows:

## Rejection Sampling

Generate a random byte array with `Ns` bytes, and attempt to map to a Scalar
by calling `DeserializeScalar` in constant time. If it succeeds, return the
result. If it fails, try again with another random byte array, until the
procedure succeeds. Failure to implement this in constant time can leak information
about the underlying corresponding Scalar.

Note the that the Scalar size might be some bits smaller than the array size,
which can result in the loop iterating more times than required. In that case
it's acceptable to set the high-order bits to 0 before calling `DeserializeScalar`,
but care must be taken to not set to zero more bits than required. For example,
in the `FROST(Ed25519, SHA-512)` ciphersuite, the order has 253 bits while
the array has 256; thus the top 3 bits of the last byte can be set to zero.

## Wide Reduction

Generate a random byte array with `l = ceil(((3 * ceil(log2(G.Order()))) / 2) / 8)`
bytes, and interpret it as an integer; reduce the integer modulo `G.Order()` and return the
result. See {{Section 5 of HASH-TO-CURVE}} for the underlying derivation of `l`.


# Test Vectors

This section contains test vectors for all ciphersuites listed in {{ciphersuites}}.
All `Element` and `Scalar` values are represented in serialized form and encoded in
hexadecimal strings. Signatures are represented as the concatenation of their
constituent parts. The input message to be signed is also encoded as a hexadecimal
string.

Each test vector consists of the following information.

- Configuration. This lists the fixed parameters for the particular instantiation
  of FROST, including MAX_PARTICIPANTS, MIN_PARTICIPANTS, and NUM_PARTICIPANTS.
- Group input parameters. This lists the group secret key and shared public key,
  generated by a trusted dealer as described in {{dep-dealer}}, as well as the
  input message to be signed. All values are encoded as hexadecimal strings.
- Signer input parameters. This lists the signing key share for each of the
  NUM_PARTICIPANTS participants.
- Round one parameters and outputs. This lists the NUM_PARTICIPANTS participants engaged
  in the protocol, identified by their integer identifier, and for each participant:
  the hiding and binding commitment values produced in {{frost-round-one}}; the randomness
  values used to derive the commitment nonces in `nonce_generate`; the resulting group
  binding factor input computed in part from the group commitment list encoded as
  described in {{dep-encoding}}; and group binding factor as computed in {{frost-round-two}}).
- Round two parameters and outputs. This lists the NUM_PARTICIPANTS participants engaged
  in the protocol, identified by their integer identifier, along with their corresponding
  output signature share as produced in {{frost-round-two}}.
- Final output. This lists the aggregate signature as produced in {{frost-aggregation}}.
