--- abstract

In this draft, we present the two-round signing variant of FROST, a Flexible Round-Optimized
Schnorr Threshold signature scheme. FROST signatures can be issued after a threshold number
of entities cooperate to issue a signature, allowing for improved distribution of trust and
redundancy with respect to a secret key. Further, this draft specifies signatures that are
compatible with {{!RFC8032}}. However, unlike {{!RFC8032}}, the protocol for producing
signatures in this draft is not deterministic, so as to ensure protection against a
key-recovery attack that is possible when even only one participant is malicious.

# Introduction

DISCLAIMER: This is a work-in-progress draft of FROST.

RFC EDITOR: PLEASE REMOVE THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH The source for this draft is
maintained in GitHub. Suggested changes should be submitted as pull requests
at https://github.com/cfrg/draft-irtf-cfrg-frost. Instructions are on that page as
well.

Unlike signatures in a single-party setting, threshold signatures
require cooperation among a threshold number of signers each holding a share
of a common private key. The security of threshold schemes in general assume
that an adversary can corrupt strictly fewer than a threshold number of participants.

This document presents a variant of a Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold (FROST)
signature scheme originally defined in {{FROST20}}. FROST reduces network overhead during
threshold signing operations while employing a novel technique to protect against forgery
attacks applicable to prior Schnorr-based threshold signature constructions. The variant of
FROST presented in this document requires two rounds to compute a signature, and implements
signing efficiency improvements described by {{Schnorr21}}. Single-round signing with FROST
is out of scope.

For select ciphersuites, the signatures produced by this draft are compatible with
{{!RFC8032}}. However, unlike {{!RFC8032}}, signatures produced by FROST are not
deterministic, since deriving nonces deterministically allows for a complete key-recovery
attack in multi-party discrete logarithm-based signatures, such as FROST.

Key generation for FROST signing is out of scope for this document. However, for completeness,
key generation with a trusted dealer is specified in {{dep-dealer}}.

# Conventions and Definitions

{::boilerplate bcp14}

The following notation and terminology are used throughout this document.

* A participant is an entity that is trusted to hold a secret share.
* `MAX_SIGNERS` denotes the number of participants, and the number of shares that `s` is split into.
  This value MUST NOT exceed 2^16-1.
* `MIN_SIGNERS` denotes the threshold number of participants required to issue a signature. More specifically,
  at least MIN_SIGNERS shares must be combined to issue a valid signature.
  This value MUST NOT exceed p.
* `NUM_SIGNERS` denotes the number of signers that participate in an invocation of FROST signing, where
  MIN_SIGNERS <= NUM_SIGNERS <= MAX_SIGNERS.
  This value MUST NOT exceed p.
* `len(x)` is the length of integer input `x` as an 8-byte, big-endian integer.
* `encode_uint16(x)`: Convert two byte unsigned integer (uint16) `x` to a 2-byte,
  big-endian byte string. For example, `encode_uint16(310) = [0x01, 0x36]`.
* `random_bytes(n)`: Outputs `n` bytes, sampled uniformly at random
using a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG).
* \|\| denotes concatenation, i.e., x \|\| y = xy.
* nil denotes an empty byte string.

Unless otherwise stated, we assume that secrets are sampled uniformly at random
using a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG); see
{{?RFC4086}} for additional guidance on the generation of random numbers.

# Cryptographic Dependencies

FROST signing depends on the following cryptographic constructs:

- Prime-order Group, {{dep-pog}};
- Cryptographic hash function, {{dep-hash}};

These are described in the following sections.

## Prime-Order Group {#dep-pog}

FROST depends on an abelian group of prime order `p`. We represent this
group as the object `G` that additionally defines helper functions described below. The group operation
for `G` is addition `+` with identity element `I`. For any elements `A` and `B` of the group `G`,
`A + B = B + A` is also a member of `G`. Also, for any `A` in `G`, there exists an element
`-A` such that `A + (-A) = (-A) + A = I`. For convenience, we use `-` to denote
the subtraction, e.g., `A - B = A + (-B)`. Scalar multiplication is equivalent to the repeated
application of the group operation on an element A with itself `r-1` times, this is denoted
as `r*A = A + ... + A`. For any element `A`, `p * A = I`. We denote `B` as a fixed generator
of the group. Scalar base multiplication is equivalent to the repeated application of the group
operation `B` with itself `r-1` times, this is denoted as `ScalarBaseMult(r)`. The set of
scalars corresponds to `GF(p)`, which refer to as the scalar field. This document uses types
`Element` and `Scalar` to denote elements of the group `G` and its set of scalars, respectively.
We denote equality comparison as `==` and assignment of values by `=`.

We now detail a number of member functions that can be invoked on `G`.

- Order(): Outputs the order of `G` (i.e. `p`).
- Identity(): Outputs the identity `Element` of the group (i.e. `I`).
- RandomScalar(): Outputs a random `Scalar` element in GF(p).
- RandomNonzeroScalar(): Outputs a random non-zero `Scalar` element in GF(p).
- SerializeElement(A): Maps an `Element` `A` to a unique byte array `buf` of fixed length `Ne`.
- DeserializeElement(buf): Attempts to map a byte array `buf` to an `Element` `A`,
  and fails if the input is not a valid byte representation of an element of
  the group. This function can raise a DeserializeError if deserialization fails
  or `A` is the identity element of the group; see {{ciphersuites}} for group-specific
  input validation steps.
- SerializeScalar(s): Maps a Scalar `s` to a unique byte array `buf` of fixed length `Ns`.
- DeserializeScalar(buf): Attempts to map a byte array `buf` to a `Scalar` `s`.
  This function can raise a DeserializeError if deserialization fails; see
  {{ciphersuites}} for group-specific input validation steps.

## Cryptographic Hash Function {#dep-hash}

FROST requires the use of a cryptographically secure hash function, generically
written as H, which functions effectively as a random oracle. For concrete
recommendations on hash functions which SHOULD be used in practice, see
{{ciphersuites}}. Using H, we introduce three separate domain-separated hashes,
H1, H2, H3, and H4, where H1, H2, and H4 map arbitrary byte strings to Scalar elements of
the prime-order group scalar field, and H3 is an alias for H with a domain separator.
The details of H1, H2, H3, and H4 vary based on ciphersuite. See {{ciphersuites}}
for more details about each.

# Helper functions {#helpers}

Beyond the core dependencies, the protocol in this document depends on the
following helper operations:

- Nonce generation, {{dep-nonces}}
- Schnorr signatures, {{dep-schnorr}};
- Polynomial operations, {{dep-polynomial}};
- Encoding operations, {{dep-encoding}};
- Signature binding {{dep-binding-factor}}, group commitment {{dep-group-commit}}, and challenge computation {{dep-sig-challenge}}

These sections describes these operations in more detail.

## Nonce generation {#dep-nonces}

To hedge against a bad RNG, we generate nonces by sourcing fresh randomness and
combine with the secret key, to create a domain-separated hash function from
the ciphersuite hash function `H`, `H4`:

~~~
  nonce_generate(secret):

  Inputs:
  - secret, a Scalar

  Outputs: nonce, a Scalar

  def nonce_generate(secret):
    k_enc = random_bytes(32)
    secret_enc = G.SerializeScalar(secret)
    return H4(k_enc || secret_enc)
~~~

## Schnorr Signature Operations {#dep-schnorr}

In the single-party setting, a Schnorr signature is generated with the
following operation.

~~~
  schnorr_signature_generate(msg, sk):

  Inputs:
  - msg, message to be signed, a byte string
  - sk, private key, a Scalar

  Outputs: signature (R, z), a pair consisting of (Element, Scalar) values

  def schnorr_signature_generate(msg, sk):
    PK = G.ScalarBaseMult(sk)
    k = nonce_generate(sk)
    R = G.ScalarBaseMult(k)

    comm_enc = G.SerializeElement(R)
    pk_enc = G.SerializeElement(PK)
    challenge_input = comm_enc || pk_enc || msg
    c = H2(challenge_input)

    z = k + (c * sk)
    return (R, z)
~~~

The corresponding verification operation is as follows. By definition,
this function assumes that all group Elements passed as input, including
the signature R component and public key, belong to prime-order group G.
Some ciphersuites defined in {{ciphersuites}} operate in settings where
some inputs may not belong to this prime-order group, e.g., because they
operate over an elliptic curve with a cofactor larger than 1. In these
settings, input validation is required before invoking this verification
function.

~~~
  schnorr_signature_verify(msg, sig, PK):

  Inputs:
  - msg, signed message, a byte string
  - sig, a tuple (R, z) output from schnorr_signature_generate or FROST
  - PK, public key, an Element

  Outputs: 1 if signature is valid, and 0 otherwise

  def schnorr_signature_verify(msg, sig = (R, z), PK):
    comm_enc = G.SerializeElement(R)
    pk_enc = G.SerializeElement(PK)
    challenge_input = comm_enc || pk_enc || msg
    c = H2(challenge_input)

    l = G.ScalarBaseMult(z)
    r = R + (c * PK)
    check = l - r
    return check == G.Identity()
~~~

## Polynomial Operations {#dep-polynomial}

This section describes operations on and associated with polynomials over Scalars
that are used in the main signing protocol. A polynomial of degree t
is represented as a list of t coefficients, where the constant term of the polynomial
is in the first position and the highest-degree coefficient is in the last position.
A point on the polynomial is a tuple (x, y), where `y = f(x)`. For notational
convenience, we refer to the x-coordinate and y-coordinate of a
point p as `p.x` and `p.y`, respectively.

### Evaluation of a polynomial

This section describes a method for evaluating a polynomial `f` at a
particular input `x`, i.e., `y = f(x)` using Horner's method.

~~~
  polynomial_evaluate(x, coeffs):

  Inputs:
  - x, input at which to evaluate the polynomial, a Scalar
  - coeffs, the polynomial coefficients, a list of Scalars

  Outputs: Scalar result of the polynomial evaluated at input x

  def polynomial_evaluate(x, coeffs):
    value = 0
    for (counter, coeff) in coeffs.reverse():
      if counter == coeffs.len() - 1:
        value += coeff // add the constant term
      else:
        value += coeff
        value *= x
    return value
~~~

### Lagrange coefficients

The function `derive_lagrange_coefficient` derives a Lagrange coefficient
to later perform polynomial interpolation, and is provided a set of x-coordinates as input.
Lagrange coefficients are used in FROST to evaluate a polynomial
`f` at point 0, i.e., `f(0)`, given a set of `t` other points.

~~~
  derive_lagrange_coefficient(x_i, L):

  Inputs:
  - x_i, an x-coordinate contained in L, a Scalar
  - L, the set of x-coordinates, each a Scalar

  Outputs: L_i, the i-th Lagrange coefficient

  Errors:
  - "invalid parameters", if any coordinate is equal to 0

  def derive_lagrange_coefficient(x_i, L):
    if x_i = 0:
      raise "invalid parameters"
    for x_j in L:
      if x_j = 0:
        raise "invalid parameters"

    numerator = 1
    denominator = 1
    for x_j in L:
      if x_j == x_i: continue
      numerator *= x_j
      denominator *= x_j - x_i

    L_i = numerator / denominator
    return L_i
~~~

### Deriving the constant term of a polynomial

Secret sharing requires "splitting" a secret, which is represented as
a constant term of some polynomial `f` of degree `t-1`. Recovering the
constant term occurs with a set of `t` points using polynomial
interpolation, defined as follows.

~~~
  Inputs:
  - points, a set of t points on a polynomial f, each a tuple of two
    Scalar values representing the x and y coordinates

  Outputs: The constant term of f, i.e., f(0)

  def polynomial_interpolation(points):
    L = []
    for point in points:
      L.append(point.x)

    f_zero = 0
    for point in points:
      delta = point.y * derive_lagrange_coefficient(point.x, L)
      f_zero = f_zero + delta

    return f_zero
~~~

Note that these coefficients can be computed once and then stored, as these
values remain constant across FROST signing sessions.

## Commitment List Encoding {#dep-encoding}

This section describes the subroutine used for encoding a list of signer
commitments into a bytestring that is used in the FROST protocol.

~~~
  Inputs:
  - commitment_list = [(i, hiding_nonce_commitment_i, binding_nonce_commitment_i), ...],
    a list of commitments issued by each signer, where each element in the list
    indicates the signer identifier i and their two commitment Element values
    (hiding_nonce_commitment_i, binding_nonce_commitment_i). This list MUST be sorted
    in ascending order by signer identifier.

  Outputs: A byte string containing the serialized representation of commitment_list

  def encode_group_commitment_list(commitment_list):
    encoded_group_commitment = nil
    for (identifier, hiding_nonce_commitment, binding_nonce_commitment) in commitment_list:
      encoded_commitment = encode_uint16(identifier) ||
                           G.SerializeElement(hiding_nonce_commitment) ||
                           G.SerializeElement(binding_nonce_commitment)
      encoded_group_commitment = encoded_group_commitment || encoded_commitment
    return encoded_group_commitment
~~~

## Binding Factor Computation {#dep-binding-factor}

This section describes the subroutine for computing the binding factor based
on the signer commitment list and message to be signed.

~~~
  Inputs:
  - encoded_commitment_list, an encoded commitment list (as computed
    by encode_group_commitment_list)
  - msg, the message to be signed.

  Outputs: A Scalar representing the binding factor

  def compute_binding_factor(encoded_commitment_list, msg):
    msg_hash = H3(msg)
    rho_input = encoded_commitment_list || msg_hash
    binding_factor = H1(rho_input)
    return binding_factor
~~~

## Group Commitment Computation {#dep-group-commit}

This section describes the subroutine for creating the group commitment
from a commitment list.

~~~
  Inputs:
  - commitment_list =
     [(i, hiding_nonce_commitment_i, binding_nonce_commitment_i), ...], a list
    of commitments issued by each signer, where each element in the list
    indicates the signer identifier i and their two commitment Element values
    (hiding_nonce_commitment_i, binding_nonce_commitment_i). This list MUST be
    sorted in ascending order by signer identifier.
  - binding_factor, a Scalar

  Outputs: An Element in G representing the group commitment

  def compute_group_commitment(commitment_list, binding_factor):
    group_hiding_commitment = G.Identity()
    group_binding_commitment = G.Identity()

    for (_, hiding_nonce_commitment, binding_nonce_commitment) in commitment_list:
      group_hiding_commitment = group_hiding_commitment + hiding_nonce_commitment
      group_binding_commitment = group_binding_commitment + binding_nonce_commitment
    return (group_hiding_commitment + group_binding_commitment * binding_factor)
~~~

## Signature Challenge Computation {#dep-sig-challenge}

This section describes the subroutine for creating the per-message challenge.

~~~
  Inputs:
  - group_commitment, an Element in G representing the group commitment
  - group_public_key, public key corresponding to the group signing key, an
    Element in G.
  - msg, the message to be signed.

  Outputs: A Scalar representing the challenge

  def compute_challenge(group_commitment, group_public_key, msg):
    group_comm_enc = G.SerializeElement(group_commitment)
    group_public_key_enc = G.SerializeElement(group_public_key)
    challenge_input = group_comm_enc || group_public_key_enc || msg
    challenge = H2(challenge_input)
    return challenge
~~~

# Two-Round FROST Signing Protocol {#frost-spec}

We now present the two-round variant of the FROST threshold signature protocol for producing Schnorr signatures.
It involves signer participants and a Coordinator. Signing participants are
entities with signing key shares that participate in the threshold signing
protocol. The Coordinator is an entity with the following responsibilities:

1. Determining which signers will participate (at least MIN_SIGNERS in number);
2. Coordinating rounds (receiving and forwarding inputs among participants); and
3. Aggregating signature shares output by each participant, and publishing the resulting signature.

FROST assumes the selection of all participants, including Coordinator and set of
signers, are all chosen external to the protocol. Note that it is possible to
deploy the protocol without a distinguished Coordinator; see {{no-coordinator}}
for more information.

Because key generation is not specified, all signers are assumed to have the (public) group state that we refer to as "group info"
below, and their corresponding signing key shares.

In particular, it is assumed that the Coordinator and each signing participant `P_i` knows the following
group info:

- Group public key, an `Element` in `G`, denoted `PK = G.ScalarMultBase(s)`, corresponding
  to the group secret key `s`, which is a `Scalar`. `PK` is an output from the group's
  key generation protocol, such as `trusted_dealer_keygen`or a DKG.
- Public keys for each signer, denoted `PK_i = G.ScalarMultBase()`, which are similarly
  outputs from the group's key generation protocol, `Element`s in `G`.

And that each participant with identifier `i`  where `i` is an integer in the range between 1
and MAX_SIGNERS additionally knows the following:

- Participant `i`s signing key share `sk_i`, which is the i-th secret share of `s`, a `Scalar`.

The exact key generation mechanism is out of scope for this specification. In general,
key generation is a protocol that outputs (1) a shared, group public key PK owned
by each Signer, and (2) individual shares of the signing key owned by each Signer.
In general, two possible key generation mechanisms are possible, one that requires
a single, trusted dealer, and the other which requires performing a distributed
key generation protocol. We highlight key generation mechanism by a trusted dealer
in {{dep-dealer}}, for reference.

This signing variant of FROST requires signers to perform two network rounds:
1) generating and publishing commitments, and 2) signature share generation and
publication. The first round serves for each participant to issue a commitment to
a nonce. The second round receives commitments for all signers as well as the message,
and issues a signature share with respect to that message. The Coordinator performs
the coordination of each of these rounds. At the end of the second round, the
Coordinator then performs an aggregation step and outputs the final signature.
This complete interaction is shown in {{fig-frost}}.

{: #fig-frost title="FROST signature overview" }

Details for round one are described in {{frost-round-one}}, and details for round two
are described in {{frost-round-two}}. The final Aggregation step is described in
{{frost-aggregation}}.

FROST assumes that all inputs to each round, especially those of which are received
over the network, are validated before use. In particular, this means that any value
of type Element or Scalar is deserialized using DeserializeElement and DeserializeScalar,
respectively, as these functions perform the necessary input validation steps.

FROST assumes reliable message delivery between the Coordinator and signing participants in
order for the protocol to complete. An attacker masquerading as another participant
will result only in an invalid signature; see {{sec-considerations}}. However, in order
to identify any participant which has misbehaved (resulting in the protocol aborting)
to take actions such as excluding them from future signing operations, we assume that
the network channel is additionally authenticated; confidentiality is not required.

## Round One - Commitment {#frost-round-one}

Round one involves each signer generating nonces and their corresponding public commitments.
A nonce is a pair of Scalar values, and a commitment is a pair of Element values.

Each signer in round one generates a nonce `nonce = (hiding_nonce, binding_nonce)` and commitment
`comm = (hiding_nonce_commitment, binding_nonce_commitment)`.

~~~
  Inputs: sk_i, the secret key share, a Scalar

  Outputs: (nonce, comm), a tuple of nonce and nonce commitment pairs,
    where each value in the nonce pair is a Scalar and each value in
    the nonce commitment pair is an Element

  def commit(sk_i):
    hiding_nonce = nonce_generate(sk_i)
    binding_nonce = nonce_generate(sk_i)
    hiding_nonce_commitment = G.ScalarBaseMult(hiding_nonce)
    binding_nonce_commitment = G.ScalarBaseMult(binding_nonce)
    nonce = (hiding_nonce, binding_nonce)
    comm = (hiding_nonce_commitment, binding_nonce_commitment)
    return (nonce, comm)
~~~

The private output `nonce` from Participant `P_i` is stored locally and kept private
for use in the second round. This nonce MUST NOT be reused in more than one invocation
of FROST, and it MUST be generated from a source of secure randomness. The public output
`comm` from Participant `P_i` is sent to the Coordinator.

<!-- The Coordinator must not get confused about which commitments come from which signers, do we need to say more about how this is done? -->

## Round Two - Signature Share Generation {#frost-round-two}

In round two, the Coordinator is responsible for sending the message to be signed, and
for choosing which signers will participate (of number at least MIN_SIGNERS). Signers
additionally require locally held data; specifically, their private key and the
nonces corresponding to their commitment issued in round one.

The Coordinator begins by sending each signer the message to be signed along with the
set of signing commitments for all other signers in the participant list. Each signer
MUST validate the inputs before processing the Coordinator's request. In particular,
the Signer MUST validate commitment_list, deserializing each group Element in the
list using DeserializeElement from {{dep-pog}}. If deserialization fails, the Signer
MUST abort the protocol. Applications which require that signers not process arbitrary
input messages are also required to also perform relevant application-layer input
validation checks; see {{message-validation}} for more details.

Upon receipt and successful input validation, each Signer then runs the following
procedure to produce its own signature share.

~~~
  Inputs:
  - identifier, Identifier i of the signer. Note identifier will never equal 0.
  - sk_i, Signer secret key share, a Scalar.
  - group_public_key, public key corresponding to the group signing key,
    an Element in G.
  - nonce_i, pair of Scalar values (hiding_nonce, binding_nonce) generated in
    round one.
  - msg, the message to be signed (sent by the Coordinator).
  - commitment_list =
      [(j, hiding_nonce_commitment_j, binding_nonce_commitment_j), ...], a
    list of commitments issued in Round 1 by each signer and sent by the Coordinator.
    Each element in the list indicates the signer identifier j and their two commitment
    Element values (hiding_nonce_commitment_j, binding_nonce_commitment_j).s
    This list MUST be sorted in ascending order by signer identifier.

  Outputs: a Scalar value representing the signature share

  def sign(identifier, sk_i, group_public_key, nonce_i, msg, commitment_list):
    # Encode the commitment list
    encoded_commitments = encode_group_commitment_list(commitment_list)

    # Compute the binding factor
    binding_factor = compute_binding_factor(encoded_commitments, msg)

    # Compute the group commitment
    group_commitment = compute_group_commitment(commitment_list, binding_factor)

    # Compute Lagrange coefficient
    participant_list = participants_from_commitment_list(commitment_list)
    lambda_i = derive_lagrange_coefficient(identifier, participant_list)

    # Compute the per-message challenge
    challenge = compute_challenge(group_commitment, group_public_key, msg)

    # Compute the signature share
    (hiding_nonce, binding_nonce) = nonce_i
    sig_share = hiding_nonce + (binding_nonce * binding_factor) + (lambda_i * sk_i * challenge)

    return sig_share
~~~

The output of this procedure is a signature share. Each signer then sends
these shares back to the Coordinator. Each signer MUST delete the nonce and
corresponding commitment after this round completes.

Upon receipt from each Signer, the Coordinator MUST validate the input
signature share using DeserializeElement. If validation fails, the Coordinator MUST abort
the protocol. If validation succeeds, the Coordinator then verifies the set of
signature shares using the following procedure.

## Signature Share Verification and Aggregation {#frost-aggregation}

After signers perform round two and send their signature shares to the Coordinator,
the Coordinator verifies each signature share for correctness. In particular,
for each signer, the Coordinator uses commitment pairs generated during round
one and the signature share generated during round two, along with other group
parameters, to check that the signature share is valid using the following procedure.

~~~
  Inputs:
  - identifier, Identifier i of the signer. Note identifier will never equal 0.
  - PK_i, the public key for the ith signer, where PK_i = G.ScalarBaseMult(sk_i),
    an Element in G
  - comm_i, pair of Element values in G (hiding_nonce_commitment, binding_nonce_commitment)
    generated in round one from the ith signer.
  - sig_share_i, a Scalar value indicating the signature share as produced in
    round two from the ith signer.
  - commitment_list =
      [(j, hiding_nonce_commitment_j, binding_nonce_commitment_j), ...], a
    list of commitments issued in Round 1 by each signer, where each element
    in the list indicates the signer identifier j and their two commitment
    Element values (hiding_nonce_commitment_j, binding_nonce_commitment_j).s
    This list MUST be sorted in ascending order by signer identifier.
  - group_public_key, public key corresponding to the group signing key,
    an Element in G.
  - msg, the message to be signed.

  Outputs: True if the signature share is valid, and False otherwise.

  def verify_signature_share(identifier, PK_i, comm_i, sig_share_i, commitment_list,
                             group_public_key, msg):
    # Encode the commitment list
    encoded_commitments = encode_group_commitment_list(commitment_list)

    # Compute the binding factor
    binding_factor = compute_binding_factor(encoded_commitments, msg)

    # Compute the group commitment
    group_commitment = compute_group_commitment(commitment_list, binding_factor)

    # Compute the commitment share
    (hiding_nonce_commitment, binding_nonce_commitment) = comm_i
    comm_share = hiding_nonce_commitment + (binding_nonce_commitment * binding_factor)

    # Compute the challenge
    challenge = compute_challenge(group_commitment, group_public_key, msg)

    # Compute Lagrange coefficient
    participant_list = participants_from_commitment_list(commitment_list)
    lambda_i = derive_lagrange_coefficient(identifier, participant_list)

    # Compute relation values
    l = G.ScalarBaseMult(sig_share_i)
    r = comm_share + ((challenge * lambda_i) * PK_i)

    return l == r
~~~

If any signature share fails to verify, i.e., if verify_signature_share returns False for
any signer share, the Coordinator MUST abort the protocol for correctness reasons.
Excluding one signer means that their nonce will not be included in the joint response `z`
and consequently the output signature will not verify.

Otherwise, if all signer shares are valid, the Coordinator performs the `aggregate` operation
and publishes the resulting signature.

~~~
  Inputs:
  - group_commitment, the group commitment returned by compute_group_commitment,
    an Element in G.
  - sig_shares, a set of signature shares z_i, Scalar values, for each signer,
    of length NUM_SIGNERS, where MIN_SIGNERS <= NUM_SIGNERS <= MAX_SIGNERS.

  Outputs: (R, z), a Schnorr signature consisting of an Element R and Scalar z.

  def aggregate(group_commitment, sig_shares):
    z = 0
    for z_i in sig_shares:
      z = z + z_i
    return (group_commitment, z)
~~~

The output signature (R, z) from the aggregation step MUST be encoded as follows
(using notation from {{Section 3 of TLS}}):

~~~
  struct {
    opaque R_encoded[Ne];
    opaque z_encoded[Ns];
  } Signature;
~~~

Where Signature.R_encoded is `G.SerializeElement(R)` and Signature.z_encoded is
`G.SerializeScalar(z)`.

# Ciphersuites {#ciphersuites}

A FROST ciphersuite must specify the underlying prime-order group details

# Security Considerations {#sec-considerations}

A security analysis of FROST exists in {{FROST20}} and {{Schnorr21}}. The protocol as specified
in this document assumes the following threat model.

* Trusted dealer. The dealer that performs key generation is trusted to follow
the protocol, although participants still are able to verify the consistency of their
shares via a VSS (verifiable secret sharing) step; see {{dep-vss}}.

* Unforgeability assuming at most `(MIN_SIGNERS-1)` corrupted signers. So long as an adversary
corrupts fewer than `MIN_SIGNERS` participants, the scheme remains secure against Existential
Unforgeability Under Chosen Message Attack (EUF-CMA) attacks, as defined in {{BonehShoup}},
Definition 13.2.

* Coordinator. We assume the Coordinator at the time of signing does not perform a
denial of service attack. A denial of service would include any action which either
prevents the protocol from completing or causing the resulting signature to be invalid.
Such actions for the latter include sending inconsistent values to signing participants,
such as messages or the set of individual commitments. Note that the Coordinator
is *not* trusted with any private information and communication at the time of signing
can be performed over a public but reliable channel.

The protocol as specified in this document does not target the following goals:

* Post quantum security. FROST, like plain Schnorr signatures, requires the hardness of the Discrete Logarithm Problem.
* Robustness. In the case of failure, FROST requires aborting the protocol.
* Downgrade prevention. All participants in the protocol are assumed to agree on what algorithms to use.
* Metadata protection. If protection for metadata is desired, a higher-level communication
channel can be used to facilitate key generation and signing.

The rest of this section documents issues particular to implementations or deployments.

## Nonce Reuse Attacks

Nonces generated by each participant in the first round of signing must be sampled
uniformly at random and cannot be derived from some deterministic function. This
is to avoid replay attacks initiated by other signers, which allows for a complete
key-recovery attack. The Coordinator MAY further hedge against nonce reuse attacks by
tracking signer nonce commitments used for a given group key, at the cost of additional
state.

## Protocol Failures

We do not specify what implementations should do when the protocol fails, other than requiring that
the protocol abort. Examples of viable failure include when a verification check returns invalid or
if the underlying transport failed to deliver the required messages.

## Removing the Coordinator Role {#no-coordinator}

In some settings, it may be desirable to omit the role of the Coordinator entirely.
Doing so does not change the security implications of FROST, but instead simply
requires each participant to communicate with all other participants. We loosely
describe how to perform FROST signing among signers without this coordinator role.
We assume that every participant receives as input from an external source the
message to be signed prior to performing the protocol.

Every participant begins by performing `commit()` as is done in the setting
where a Coordinator is used. However, instead of sending the commitment
to the Coordinator, every participant instead will publish
this commitment to every other participant. Then, in the second round, signers will already have
sufficient information to perform signing. They will directly perform `sign`.
All participants will then publish their signature shares to one another. After having
received all signature shares from all other signers, each signer will then perform
`verify_signature_share` and then `aggregate` directly.

The requirements for the underlying network channel remain the same in the setting
where all participants play the role of the Coordinator, in that all messages that
are exchanged are public and so the channel simply must be reliable. However, in
the setting that a player attempts to split the view of all other players by
sending disjoint values to a subset of players, the signing operation will output
an invalid signature. To avoid this denial of service, implementations may wish
to define a mechanism where messages are authenticated, so that cheating players
can be identified and excluded.

## Input Message Validation {#message-validation}

Some applications may require that signers only process messages of a certain
structure. For example, in digital currency applications wherein multiple
signers may collectively sign a transaction, it is reasonable to require that
each signer check the input message to be a syntactically valid transaction.
As another example, use of threshold signatures in TLS {{?TLS=RFC8446}} to produce
signatures of transcript hashes might require that signers check that the input
message is a valid TLS transcript from which the corresponding transcript hash
can be derived.

In general, input message validation is an application-specific consideration
that varies based on the use case and threat model. However, it is RECOMMENDED
that applications take additional precautions and validate inputs so that signers
do not operate as signing oracles for arbitrary messages.

# Trusted Dealer Key Generation {#dep-dealer}

One possible key generation mechanism is to depend on a trusted dealer, wherein the
dealer generates a group secret `s` uniformly at random and uses Shamir and Verifiable
Secret Sharing as described in {{dep-shamir}} and {{dep-vss}} to create secret
shares of `s` to be sent to all other participants. We highlight at a high level how this
operation can be performed.

The dealer is trusted to 1) generate good randomness, and 2) delete secret values after distributing shares to each participant,
and 3) keep secret values confidential.

~~~
  Inputs:
  - s, a group secret, Scalar, that MUST be derived from at least Ns bytes of entropy
  - MAX_SIGNERS, the number of shares to generate, an integer
  - MIN_SIGNERS, the threshold of the secret sharing scheme, an integer

  Outputs:
  - signer_private_keys, MAX_SIGNERS shares of the secret key s, each a Scalar value.
  - vss_commitment, a vector commitment of Elements in G, to each of the coefficients
    in the polynomial defined by secret_key_shares and whose constant term is
    G.ScalarBaseMult(s).

  def trusted_dealer_keygen(s, MAX_SIGNERS, MIN_SIGNERS):
    signer_private_keys, coefficients = secret_share_shard(secret_key, MAX_SIGNERS, MIN_SIGNERS)
    vss_commitment = vss_commit(coefficients):
    PK = G.ScalarBaseMult(secret_key)
    return signer_private_keys, vss_commitment
~~~

It is assumed the dealer then sends one secret key share to each of the NUM_SIGNERS participants, along with `C`.
After receiving their secret key share and `C`, participants MUST abort if they do not have the same view of `C`.
Otheriwise, each participant MUST perform `vss_verify(secret_key_share_i, C)`, and abort if the check fails.
The trusted dealer MUST delete the secret_key and secret_key_shares upon completion.

Use of this method for key generation requires a mutually authenticated secure channel
between the dealer and participants to send secret key shares, wherein the channel provides confidentiality
and integrity. Mutually authenticated TLS is one possible deployment option.

## Shamir Secret Sharing {#dep-shamir}

In Shamir secret sharing, a dealer distributes a secret `Scalar` `s` to `n` participants
in such a way that any cooperating subset of `MIN_SIGNERS` participants can recover the
secret. There are two basic steps in this scheme: (1) splitting a secret into
multiple shares, and (2) combining shares to reveal the resulting secret.

This secret sharing scheme works over any field `F`. In this specification, `F` is
the scalar field of the prime-order group `G`.

The procedure for splitting a secret into shares is as follows.

~~~
  secret_share_shard(s, MAX_SIGNERS, MIN_SIGNERS):

  Inputs:
  - s, secret value to be shared, a Scalar
  - MAX_SIGNERS, the number of shares to generate, an integer
  - MIN_SIGNERS, the threshold of the secret sharing scheme, an integer

  Outputs:
  - secret_key_shares, A list of MAX_SIGNERS number of secret shares, which is a tuple
    consisting of the participant identifier and the key share, each of which is a Scalar
  - coefficients, a vector of the t coefficients which uniquely determine
    a polynomial f.

  Errors:
  - "invalid parameters", if MIN_SIGNERS > MAX_SIGNERS or if MIN_SIGNERS is less than 2

  def secret_share_shard(s, MAX_SIGNERS, MIN_SIGNERS):
    if MIN_SIGNERS > MAX_SIGNERS:
      raise "invalid parameters"
    if MIN_SIGNERS < 2:
      raise "invalid parameters"

    # Generate random coefficients for the polynomial, yielding
    # a polynomial of degree (MIN_SIGNERS - 1)
    coefficients = [s]
    for i in range(1, MIN_SIGNERS):
      coefficients.append(G.RandomScalar())

    # Evaluate the polynomial for each point x=1,...,n
    secret_key_shares = []
    for x_i in range(1, MAX_SIGNERS + 1):
      y_i = polynomial_evaluate(x_i, coefficients)
      secret_key_share_i = (x_i, y_i)
      secret_key_share.append(secret_key_share_i)
    return secret_key_shares, coefficients
~~~

Let `points` be the output of this function. The i-th element in `points` is
the share for the i-th participant, which is the randomly generated polynomial
evaluated at coordinate `i`. We denote a secret share as the tuple `(i, points[i])`,
and the list of these shares as `shares`.
`i` MUST never equal `0`; recall that `f(0) = s`, where `f` is the polynomial defined in a Shamir secret sharing operation.

The procedure for combining a `shares` list of length `MIN_SIGNERS` to recover the
secret `s` is as follows.

~~~
  secret_share_combine(shares):

  Inputs:
  - shares, a list of at minimum MIN_SIGNERS secret shares, each a tuple (i, f(i))

  Outputs: The resulting secret s, a Scalar, that was previously split into shares

  Errors:
  - "invalid parameters", if less than MIN_SIGNERS input shares are provided

  def secret_share_combine(shares):
    if len(shares) < MIN_SIGNERS:
      raise "invalid parameters"
    s = polynomial_interpolation(shares)
    return s

## Verifiable Secret Sharing {#dep-vss}

Feldman's Verifiable Secret Sharing (VSS) builds upon Shamir secret sharing,
adding a verification step to demonstrate the consistency of a participant's
share with a public commitment to the polynomial `f` for which the secret `s`
is the constant term. This check ensure that all participants have a point
(their share) on the same polynomial, ensuring that they can later reconstruct
the correct secret.

The procedure for committing to a polynomial `f` of degree `MIN_SIGNERS-1` is as follows.

~~~
  vss_commit(coeffs):

  Inputs:
  - coeffs, a vector of the MIN_SIGNERS coefficients which uniquely determine
  a polynomial f.

  Outputs: a commitment vss_commitment, which is a vector commitment to each of the
  coefficients in coeffs, where each element of the vector commitment is an `Element` in `G`.

  def vss_commit(coeffs):
    vss_commitment = []
    for coeff in coeffs:
      A_i = G.ScalarBaseMult(coeff)
      vss_commitment.append(A_i)
    return vss_commitment
~~~

The procedure for verification of a participant's share is as follows.
If `vss_verify` fails, the participant MUST abort the protocol, and failure should be investigated out of band.

~~~
  vss_verify(share_i, vss_commitment):

  Inputs:
  - share_i: A tuple of the form (i, sk_i), where i indicates the participant
    identifier, and sk_i the participant's secret key, a secret share of the
    constant term of f, where sk_i is a Scalar.
  - vss_commitment: A VSS commitment to a secret polynomial f, a vector commitment
    to each of the coefficients in coeffs, where each element of the vector commitment
    is an Element

  Outputs: 1 if sk_i is valid, and 0 otherwise

  vss_verify(share_i, commitment)
    (i, sk_i) = share_i
    S_i = ScalarBaseMult(sk_i)
    S_i' = G.Identity()
    for j in range(0, MIN_SIGNERS-1):
      S_i' += vss_commitment[j] * i^j
    if S_i == S_i':
      return 1
    return 0
~~~

We now define how the Coordinator and signing participants can derive group info,
which is an input into the FROST signing protocol.

~~~
    derive_group_info(MAX_SIGNERS, MIN_SIGNERS, vss_commitment):

    Inputs:
    - MAX_SIGNERS, the number of shares to generate, an integer
    - MIN_SIGNERS, the threshold of the secret sharing scheme, an integer
    - vss_commitment: A VSS commitment to a secret polynomial f, a vector commitment to each of the
    coefficients in coeffs, where each element of the vector commitment is an Element in G.

    Outputs:
    - PK, the public key representing the group, an Element.
    - signer_public_keys, a list of MAX_SIGNERS public keys PK_i for i=1,...,MAX_SIGNERS,
      where each PK_i is the public key, an Element, for participant i.

    derive_group_info(MAX_SIGNERS, MIN_SIGNERS, vss_commitment)
      PK = vss_commitment[0]
      signer_public_keys = []
      for i in range(1, MAX_SIGNERS+1):
        PK_i = G.Identity()
        for j in range(0, MIN_SIGNERS):
          PK_i += vss_commitment[j] * i^j
        signer_public_keys.append(PK_i)
      return PK, signer_public_keys

# Test Vectors

This section contains test vectors for all ciphersuites listed in {{ciphersuites}}.
All `Element` and `Scalar` values are represented in serialized form and encoded in
hexadecimal strings. Signatures are represented as the concatenation of their
constituent parts. The input message to be signed is also encoded as a hexadecimal
string.

Each test vector consists of the following information.

- Configuration: This lists the fixed parameters for the particular instantiation
  of FROST, including MAX_SIGNERS, MIN_SIGNERS, and NUM_SIGNERS.
- Group input parameters: This lists the group secret key and shared public key,
  generated by a trusted dealer as described in {{dep-dealer}}, as well as the
  input message to be signed. All values are encoded as hexadecimal strings.
- Signer input parameters: This lists the signing key share for each of the
  NUM_SIGNERS signers.
- Round one parameters and outputs: This lists the NUM_SIGNERS participants engaged
  in the protocol, identified by their integer identifier, the hiding and binding commitment
  values produced in {{frost-round-one}}, as well as the resulting group binding factor input,
  computed in part from the group commitment list encoded as described in {{dep-encoding}},
  and group binding factor as computed in {{frost-round-two}}).
- Round two parameters and outputs: This lists the NUM_SIGNERS participants engaged
  in the protocol, identified by their integer identifier, along with their corresponding
  output signature share as produced in {{frost-round-two}}.
- Final output: This lists the aggregate signature as produced in {{frost-aggregation}}.
